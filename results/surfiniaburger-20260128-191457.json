A stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histology confirmed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling showed:\n\n- H3\u202fK27M mutation (H3F3A) confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n- Co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation.\n- PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6\u2011fold increase by FISH).\n- Germline TP53 R175H pathogenic variant (identified on a cancer predisposition panel).\n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions, completed 4\u202fweeks prior to presentation. At the end of radiation, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (600\u202fmg orally once weekly) and panobinostat (20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly).

The context mentions that the MRI shows a lesion in the ventral pons, and there's a debate between DIPG and pHGG. But no biopsy has been done yet, so the pathology is pending.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard treatments for these tumors. DIPG, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, is typically treated with radiation therapy as the mainstay. Chemotherapy isn't usually part of the initial treatment for DIPG because it hasn't shown significant benefit in clinical trials. On the other hand, high-grade gliomas (like pHGG) might involve chemotherapy, often with regimens like temozolomide or other agents as part of protocols such as St. Jude's or COG trials.\n\nBut the key here is that the diagnosis isn't confirmed yet. The radiology reports are conflicting, and there's no pathology report. The oncology team hasn't reached a consensus. So, without a confirmed diagnosis, it's unclear which treatment protocol to follow. \n\nThe question is specifically about the initial chemotherapy regimen. However, for DIPG, the standard initial treatment is radiation, not chemo. For pHGG, chemo might be considered, but again, without a confirmed diagnosis, it's uncertain. The context states that no biopsy has been performed, so the exact type isn't known. \n\nLooking at the context again: the radiology report says \"compatible with DIPG,\" but a second opinion suggests pHGG. The oncology team is discussing options but no consensus. The pathology report is pending. So, the answer should be that without a confirmed diagnosis, there's no recommended initial chemo regimen yet. The standard for DIPG is radiation, and chemo isn't standard initial treatment.

The context mentions that the MRI shows a lesion in the ventral pons, and there's a debate between DIPG and pHGG. But no biopsy has been done yet, so the pathology is pending.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard treatments for these tumors. DIPG, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, is typically treated with radiation therapy as the mainstay. Chemotherapy isn't usually part of the initial treatment for DIPG because it hasn't shown significant benefit in clinical trials. On the other hand, high-grade gliomas (like pHGG) might involve chemotherapy, often with regimens like temozolomide or other agents as part of protocols such as St. Jude's or COG trials.\n\nBut the key here is that the diagnosis isn't confirmed yet. The radiology reports are conflicting, and there's no pathology report. The oncology team hasn't reached a consensus. So, without a confirmed diagnosis, it's unclear which treatment protocol to follow. \n\nThe question is specifically about the initial chemotherapy regimen. However, for DIPG, the standard initial treatment is radiation, not chemo. For pHGG, chemo might be considered, but again, without a confirmed diagnosis, it's uncertain. The context states that no biopsy has been performed, so the exact type isn't known. \n\nLooking at the context again: the radiology report says \"compatible with DIPG,\" but a second opinion suggests pHGG. The oncology team is discussing options but no consensus. The pathology report is pending. So, the answer should be that without a confirmed diagnosis, there's no recommended initial chemo regimen yet. The standard for DIPG is radiation, and chemo isn't standard initial treatment. For pHGG, chemo might be part of the regimen, but since it's not confirmed, they can't proceed with that yet.\n\nI need to check if the context provides any specific info about treatment recommendations. The context says the oncology team discussed potential options but no consensus. There's no mention of a specific chemo regimen being recommended. So, the answer is that there isn't a recommended initial chemo regimen because the diagnosis isn't confirmed, and for DIPG, chemo isn't standard initial treatment.\n\nNow, looking for quotes in the context.

The context mentions that the patient has a CYP3A4*22 loss-of-function allele, which reduces panobinostat clearance by 30%. The trial protocol states that for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss-of-function variant, the panobinostat dose should be reduced by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2 regimen.\n\nThe standard dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week. The patient's BSA is 1.0 m\u00b2, so the standard dose per administration would be 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.0 m\u00b2 = 20 mg. But since there's a 25% reduction needed, I need to calculate 25% of 20 mg and subtract that. 25% of 20 is 5, so 20 - 5 = 15 mg per dose. Wait, but the question is about the dose per administration, right? The protocol says reduce the dose by 25% from 20 mg/m\u00b2. So 20 mg/m\u00b2 reduced by 25% is 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, it's 15 mg per dose, three times a week.\n\nNow, for the median overall survival. The interim analysis states that patients with both mutations on the combination therapy had a median OS of 13 months.

The question is whether the patient is eligible for a new panobinostat-based targeted-therapy trial and what the maximum remaining cumulative dose he can receive in the next two cycles is.\n\nFirst, I need to check the eligibility criteria. The trial has three main criteria:\n\n1. Confirmed H3K27M mutation.\n2. No prior exposure to any histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.\n3. Cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\n\nLooking at the context, the patient's molecular profiling showed an H3F3A K27M mutation. Wait, the trial requires H3K27M mutation. H3F3A is a gene that encodes the H3.3 histone variant, and the K27M mutation here is the same as H3K27M. So that's probably satisfied. The context says \"H3F3A K27M mutation,\" which is a type of H3K27M mutation, so criterion 1 is met.\n\nNext, criterion 2: no prior exposure to any HDAC inhibitor. The patient was treated with panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. The context states he completed two cycles of panobinostat at 10 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle. So he has prior exposure to an HDAC inhibitor. Wait, but the trial's second criterion is \"no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor.\" If he's already taken panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor, then he would not meet this criterion. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the trial's eligibility criteria (2) says \"no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor.\" However, the patient was given panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. So that would disqualify him. But wait, maybe the trial allows prior exposure as long as it's within certain limits? Wait, no\u2014the second criterion is \"no prior exposure,\" meaning he shouldn't have taken any HDAC inhibitors before. But he did take panobinostat. So that would make him ineligible. However, let me check the exact wording again.\n\nWait, the trial's criteria: (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor. But the patient received panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. So that would violate criterion 2, making him ineligible. But wait, the problem says \"the eligibility criteria for this trial are: (1) confirmed H3K27M mutation; (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor; and (3) a cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\"\n\nWait, but the patient has already received panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor, so he does have prior exposure. Therefore, he doesn't meet criterion 2, so he's ineligible. But wait, maybe the trial's criterion (2) is about prior exposure before enrolling in the trial. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe patient completed two cycles of panobinostat as part of his prior treatment. The trial is a new targeted-therapy trial. So the \"no prior exposure\" would refer to before enrolling in this new trial. Since he already took panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) before, he's had prior exposure, thus failing criterion 2. Therefore, he's ineligible.\n\nBut wait, the third criterion mentions \"cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\" Wait, the study period here might refer to the trial period. Wait, the exact wording: \"a cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\" Hmm, maybe \"study period\" refers to the trial's duration. But the patient already received panobinostat before the trial. Wait, the eligibility criteria are for enrollment, so prior exposure would be before enrollment.\n\nWait, let's parse the criteria again:\n\n(2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor.\n\nSo prior to enrolling in the trial, he must not have been exposed to any HDAC inhibitor. But he was given panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) in his prior treatment. Therefore, he has prior exposure, so he doesn't meet criterion 2.

Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3F3A K27M mutation, concurrent TP53 loss\u2011of\u2011function, and PDGFRA amplification. The patient's calculated body surface area (BSA) is 1.3\u202fm\u00b2. He was enrolled in a phase\u202fII protocol consisting of conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions, with concurrent oral ONC201 administered at 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly.

The only reported adverse events were grade\u202f1 nausea and transient thrombocytopenia (platelets 110\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L) that resolved without intervention. Follow\u2011up MRI at 3\u202fmonths post\u2011radiation demonstrated interval progression of the pontine mass with new involvement of the middle cerebellar peduncles. The treating team considered enrollment in a new targeted\u2011therapy trial. The eligibility criteria for this trial are: (1) confirmed H3K27M mutation; (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor; and (3) a cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200\u202fmg total across the study period. The trial protocol permits additional panobinostat dosing at 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 on days\u202f1\u20115 of each 28\u2011day cycle, provided the cumulative dose limit is not breached.",

The question is asking for two things: the adjusted panobinostat dose for the patient and the expected median overall survival if he continues the combination therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to find the information about the dose adjustment. The context mentions that the patient has a CYP3A4*22 loss-of-function allele, which reduces panobinostat clearance by 30%. The trial protocol states that for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss-of-function variant, the panobinostat dose should be reduced by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2 regimen.\n\nThe standard dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week. The patient's BSA is 1.0 m\u00b2, so the standard dose per administration would be 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.0 m\u00b2 = 20 mg. But since there's a 25% reduction needed, I need to calculate 25% of 20 mg and subtract that. 25% of 20 is 5, so 20 - 5 = 15 mg per dose. Wait, but the question is about the dose per administration, right? The protocol says reduce the dose by 25% from 20 mg/m\u00b2. So 20 mg/m\u00b2 reduced by 25% is 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, it's 15 mg per dose, three times a week.\n\nNow, for the median overall survival. The interim analysis states that patients with both mutations on the combination therapy had a median OS of 13 months. The patient has both H3-K27M and ACVR1 mutations, so he should expect 13 months.\n\nWait, let me check the quotes again. The context says: \"Interim analysis of the trial reported that patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\"\n\nSo the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2, but since BSA is 1.0, it's 15 mg per dose. Wait, the dose is given as mg/m\u00b2, so the adjusted dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 minus 25%, which is 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, each dose is 15 mg. The question asks for the adjusted panobinostat dose, so it's 15 mg/m\u00b2, but since BSA is 1.0, maybe they just say 15 mg. Wait, the protocol specifies the dose as 20 mg/m\u00b2, so the adjusted would be 15 mg/m\u00b2. But the answer should probably state it as 15 mg/m\u00b2 per dose, three times a week.\n\nWait, the question says \"what should be the adjusted panobinostat dose for this patient\". The standard is 20 mg/m\u00b2, reduced by 25% because of CYP3A4 variant. So 20 * 0.75 = 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, each dose is 15 mg. But the dose is prescribed per m\u00b2, so the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nFor the survival, it's 13 months as per the interim analysis for combination therapy in patients with both mutations.\n\nNow, checking the proof sections. The key quotes would be:\n\nFor dose adjustment: \"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\"\n\nFor survival: \"patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths\"\n\nSo the answer should be adjusted dose of 15 mg/m\u00b2 (which for BSA 1.0 is 15 mg per dose) and median OS of 13 months.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\"\n\"patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f",

Wait, but the question is about the dose per administration, right? The protocol says reduce the dose by 25% from 20 mg/m\u00b2. So 20 mg/m\u00b2 reduced by 25% is 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, it's 15 mg per dose, three times a week.\n\nNow, for the median overall survival. The interim analysis states that patients with both mutations on the combination therapy had a median OS of 13 months. The patient has both H3-K27M and ACVR1 mutations, so he should expect 13 months.\n\nWait, let me check the quotes again. The context says: \"Interim analysis of the trial reported that patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\"\n\nSo the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2, but since BSA is 1.0, it's 15 mg per dose. Wait, the dose is given as mg/m\u00b2, so the adjusted dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 minus 25%, which is 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, each dose is 15 mg. The question asks for the adjusted panobinostat dose, so it's 15 mg/m\u00b2, but since BSA is 1.0, maybe they just say 15 mg. Wait, the protocol specifies the dose as 20 mg/m\u00b2, so the adjusted would be 15 mg/m\u00b2. But the answer should probably state it as 15 mg/m\u00b2 per dose, three times a week.\n\nWait, the question says \"what should be the adjusted panobinostat dose for this patient\". The standard is 20 mg/m\u00b2, reduced by 25% because of CYP3A4 variant. So 20 * 0.75 = 15 mg/m\u00b2. Since BSA is 1.0, each dose is 15 mg. But the dose is prescribed per m\u00b2, so the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nFor the survival, it's 13 months as per the interim analysis for combination therapy in patients with both mutations.\n\nNow, checking the proof sections. The key quotes would be:\n\nFor dose adjustment: \"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\"\n\nFor survival: \"patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths\"\n\nSo the answer should be adjusted dose of 15 mg/m\u00b2 (which for BSA 1.0 is 15 mg per dose) and median OS of 13 months.",

The question is whether the patient is eligible for a new panobinostat-based targeted-therapy trial and what the maximum remaining cumulative dose he can receive in the next two cycles is.\n\nFirst, I need to check the eligibility criteria. The trial has three main criteria:\n\n1. Confirmed H3K27M mutation.\n2. No prior exposure to any histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.\n3. Cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\n\nLooking at the context, the patient's molecular profiling showed an H3F3A K27M mutation. Wait, the trial requires H3K27M mutation. H3F3A is a gene that encodes the H3.3 histone variant, and the K27M mutation here is the same as H3K27M. So that's probably satisfied. The context says \"H3F3A K27M mutation,\" which is a type of H3K27M mutation, so criterion 1 is met.\n\nNext, criterion 2: no prior exposure to any HDAC inhibitor. The patient was treated with panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. The context states he completed two cycles of panobinostat at 10 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle. So he has prior exposure to an HDAC inhibitor. Wait, but the trial's second criterion is \"no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor.\" If he's already taken panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor, then he would not meet this criterion. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the trial's eligibility criteria (2) says \"no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor.\" However, the patient was given panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. So that would disqualify him. But wait, maybe the trial allows prior exposure as long as it's within certain limits? Wait, no\u2014the second criterion is \"no prior exposure,\" meaning he shouldn't have taken any HDAC inhibitors before. But he did take panobinostat. So that would make him ineligible. However, let me check the exact wording again.\n\nWait, the trial's criteria: (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor. But the patient received panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor. So that would violate criterion 2, making him ineligible. But wait, the problem says \"the eligibility criteria for this trial are: (1) confirmed H3K27M mutation; (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor; and (3) a cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\"\n\nWait, but the patient has already received panobinostat, which is an HDAC inhibitor, so he does have prior exposure. Therefore, he doesn't meet criterion 2, so he's ineligible. But wait, maybe the trial's criterion (2) is about prior exposure before enrolling in the trial. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe patient completed two cycles of panobinostat as part of his prior treatment. The trial is a new targeted-therapy trial. So the \"no prior exposure\" would refer to before enrolling in this new trial. Since he already took panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) before, he's had prior exposure, thus failing criterion 2. Therefore, he's ineligible.\n\nBut wait, the third criterion mentions \"cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\" Wait, the study period here might refer to the trial period. Wait, the exact wording: \"a cumulative panobinostat exposure not exceeding 200 mg total across the study period.\" Hmm, maybe \"study period\" refers to the trial's duration.

But he was given panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) in his prior treatment. Therefore, he has prior exposure, so he doesn't meet criterion 2. Thus, he's ineligible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the eligibility criteria for this trial are: (1) confirmed H3K27M mutation; (2) no prior exposure to any histone deacetylase inhibitor; and (3) a cumulative panobinostat exposure not\n</think>\n",

A stereotactic biopsy was performed, revealing a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma with WHO grade IV features. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3F3A K27M mutation, concurrent TP53 loss\u2011of\u2011function, and PDGFRA amplification. The patient's calculated body surface area (BSA) is 1.3\u202fm\u00b2. He was enrolled in a phase\u202fII protocol consisting of conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions, with concurrent oral ONC201 administered at 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly.
