The user is asking for the recommended radiation dose in Gy for a 7-year-old child diagnosed with what seems to be a diffuse midline glioma, specifically H3-K27M-mutant, based on the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard treatment for DIPG or diffuse midline glioma. From what I know, DIPG is a type of diffuse midline glioma often found in the pons, and the standard treatment is radiation therapy. The typical dose I remember is around 54-60 Gy, but I need to check if the context provides specific information.\n\nLooking at the context: The MRI shows a lesion consistent with DIPG, and the pathology reports mention high-grade glioma, IDH-wildtype, and possible H3-K27M mutation. However, molecular testing wasn't done due to insufficient tissue. The question is about the recommended radiation dose.\n\nWait, the context given doesn't mention anything about treatment protocols or radiation doses. The context only describes the diagnosis and the pathology reports. There's no information on treatment guidelines here. The user is asking for the recommended dose, but the context provided doesn't include that detail. \n\nThe instructions say I must use direct quotes from the context to support the answer. If there's no quote about the radiation dose, I can't answer. Let me check again. The context talks about the diagnosis, MRI findings, pathology reports, but no treatment info. The question is about the recommended dose, which isn't in the provided context. \n\nSo, according to the rules, if I can't find a quote in the context that states the radiation dose, I shouldn't provide an answer.
