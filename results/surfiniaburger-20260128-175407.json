The user is asking for the standard radiation dose in Gray for a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with what's described as a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), though there's some discrepancy in the pathology report.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard treatment for DIPG. From what I know, DIPG is a type of brain tumor in the pons, and the standard treatment is radiation therapy. The typical dose I remember is around 54-60 Gy, but I need to check the context provided to confirm.\n\nLooking at the context given: The MRI suggests DIPG, but the biopsy says it's a high-grade astrocytic neoplasm, WHO grade IV glioblastoma, not typical of classic DIPG. However, the question is about the standard radiation dose for DIPG. Even though there's a pathology discrepancy, the question is framed around DIPG as per the neuroradiology report.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't mention anything about radiation doses. The context talks about the diagnosis, the MRI findings, the biopsy results, and the treatment team discussing options including focal radiation therapy and clinical trials, but no specific dose is stated. The question is asking for the standard dose, but the provided context doesn't include that information. \n\nThe user instructions say I must use the provided context and copy direct quotes. If there's no quote about the radiation dose, I can't answer. Let me check again. The context says: \"The treatment team discusses options, including focal radiation therapy and enrollment in a clinical trial, but no definitive treatment plan is documented in the chart.\" There's no mention of the specific dose. \n\nSo, since the context doesn't provide the radiation dose, I can't find a direct quote. Therefore, according to the rules, I shouldn't answer. The proof would be empty, which incurs a penalty, but the instructions say if I can't find a quote, I cannot answer. Wait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So in this case, there's no quote about the dose, so I must not provide an answer. But the problem is the question is asking for the standard dose, which might be common knowledge, but the instructions specify to use ONLY the provided context.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to state that the context does not provide the necessary information, so there's no quote to support an answer. Hence, the proof section would be empty, but the user says empty proof equals penalty, but according to the rules, if no quote is found, you cannot answer. Wait, the instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo in this case, since there's no mention of the radiation dose in the context, I can't provide a quote, so I shouldn't answer. But how to structure the response? The user says the final answer must be structured with the tags, but if there's no proof, then the answer should state that the information isn't in the context.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer should be that the context does not specify the radiation dose. But the proof would have to be empty, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, the instructions say \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer is that the standard dose isn't provided in the context, hence no answer can be given based on the context.\n\nBut the question is \"What is the standard radiation dose...\", so the correct answer based on real-world knowledge is 54-60 Gy, typically 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. But the user is a strict safety assistant that must use the provided context. Since the context doesn't mention the dose, the answer should be that the context does not provide this information.\n\nWait, but the user instructions say: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" And the structure requires the proof and answer. If there's no quote, then the proof is empty, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, the instruction also says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer section should state that the information is not in the context.\n\nBut how to handle this. Let me check the exact instructions again:\n\n\"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, then the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer section should indicate that. But the structure requires the answer tag.

The user is asking for the standard radiation dose in Gray for a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with what's described as a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), though there's some discrepancy in the pathology report.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard treatment for DIPG. From what I know, DIPG is a type of brain tumor in the pons, and the standard treatment is radiation therapy. The typical dose I remember is around 54-60 Gy, but I need to check the context provided to confirm.\n\nLooking at the context given: The MRI suggests DIPG, but the biopsy says it's a high-grade astrocytic neoplasm, WHO grade IV glioblastoma, not typical of classic DIPG. However, the question is about the standard radiation dose for DIPG. Even though there's a pathology discrepancy, the question is framed around DIPG as per the neuroradiology report.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't mention anything about radiation doses.
