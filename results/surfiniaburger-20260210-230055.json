The question is asking for two things: the adjusted panobinostat dose for the patient and the expected median overall survival if he continues the combination therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the adjusted dose. The context says the standard panobinostat dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week. But the patient has a CYP3A4*22 loss-of-function allele, which reduces panobinostat clearance by 30%. The trial protocol specifies that for such patients, the dose should be reduced by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, standard dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2. A 25% reduction would be 20 * 0.25 = 5 mg/m\u00b2. Therefore, 20 - 5 = 15 mg/m\u00b2. The patient's BSA is 1.0 m\u00b2, so the actual dose per administration would be 15 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.0 m\u00b2 = 15 mg. But the question asks for the dose in mg/m\u00b2, so it's 15 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week.\n\nNext, the median overall survival. The interim analysis states that patients with both mutations on the combination therapy had a median OS of 13 months, compared to 9 months for monotherapy. Since the patient is enrolled in the trial receiving the combination (ONC201 plus panobinostat), the expected median OS should be 13 months.\n\nI need to check the context for exact quotes. For the dose adjustment: \"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss-of-function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2 regimen.\" So 20 mg/m\u00b2 reduced by 25% is 15 mg/m\u00b2. The BSA is 1.0, so the dose per administration is 15 mg, but the question asks for the dose in mg/m\u00b2, which is 15 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nFor survival: \"patients with both H3-K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13 months.\"\n\nSo the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 and median OS is 13 months.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\"\n\"patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe adjusted panobinostat dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 administered orally three times per week.

MRI revealed a classic diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) spanning the pons. Molecular profiling of the biopsy specimen demonstrated a heterozygous H3F3A\u2011K27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1\u2011R206H activating mutation. Baseline hepatic panel was normal. The patient completed standard focal radiation therapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) three weeks ago.\n\nBecause of the dual H3\u2011K27M/ACVR1 genotype, the oncology team enrolled him in the multi\u2011center Phase I/II trial NCT04567890, which evaluates the oral DRD2 antagonist ONC201 combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The protocol specifies ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally once weekly and panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given orally three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a 28\u2011day cycle.\n\nInterim analysis of the trial reported that patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\n\nPharmacogenomic testing revealed that the patient carries a CYP3A4*22 loss\u2011of\u2011function allele, which is known to reduce panobinostat clearance by approximately 30\u202f%. The trial protocol includes a dose\u2011modification guideline: for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\n\nThe patient\u2019s body surface area (BSA) is calculated at 1.0\u202fm\u00b2.

Apply the protocol\u2019s recommendation: reduce panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard dose.\n4. Calculate the reduced dose: 25\u202f% of 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 = 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2; therefore the adjusted dose = 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u2013 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 = 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2.\n5. Verify the expected median overall survival for patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations receiving the combination therapy, as reported in the trial\u2019s interim analysis.\n6. The trial states a median OS of 13\u202fmonths for this genotype when treated with ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat.\n7.

So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for the patient after progression on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context is a medical case study about a 7-year-old boy with DIPG who has specific mutations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the patient's situation. He has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He went through radiation and then a Phase II trial combining panobinostat, ONC201, and temozolomide. But at 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nThe key here is the molecular profile. The context mentions that for tumors with both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations, the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen, which is worse than H3K27M-only tumors. So, the current treatment isn't effective for dual-mutant cases.\n\nLooking at the next options, the trial protocol allowed crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) upon progression, but only if they hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition. The patient hasn't had any ACVR1 inhibitors before, so he's eligible. The ACVR1-specific trial (NCT04556789) reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant patients with manageable side effects.\n\nOption (2) is off-label momelotinib, which is also an ACVR1 inhibitor. But the tumor board favored option (1) because the patient hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition, and the trial data supports LDN-193189's efficacy in this subgroup. The context states the board preferred the Phase I trial over off-label use, likely due to structured monitoring and reported outcomes.\n\nI need to check the proof. The context says: \"the trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1-targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since the patient hasn't had ACVR1 inhibitors, he qualifies. Also, \"the board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38%...\"\n\nSo the answer should be option (1), enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial.

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle. The trial protocol required continued corticosteroid support; due to a documented anaphylaxis to dexamethasone, the patient was switched to methylprednisolone 1\u202fmg/kg/day intravenously, then tapered to oral prednisolone 0.5\u202fmg/kg/day.\n\nInterim efficacy data from the trial (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) showed:\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 12% (partial responses) across all DIPG participants.\n- Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations.\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 9.8\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only, versus 7.3\u202fmonths for the dual\u2011mutant subgroup.\n\nAt the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement and increased FLAIR signal, consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",

The question is asking for two things: the adjusted panobinostat dose for the patient and the expected median overall survival if he continues the combination therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the adjusted dose. The context says the standard panobinostat dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week. But the patient has a CYP3A4*22 loss-of-function allele, which reduces panobinostat clearance by 30%. The trial protocol specifies that for such patients, the dose should be reduced by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, standard dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2. A 25% reduction would be 20 * 0.25 = 5 mg/m\u00b2. Therefore, 20 - 5 = 15 mg/m\u00b2. The patient's BSA is 1.0 m\u00b2, so the actual dose per administration would be 15 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.0 m\u00b2 = 15 mg. But the question asks for the dose in mg/m\u00b2, so it's 15 mg/m\u00b2 three times a week.\n\nNext, the median overall survival. The interim analysis states that patients with both mutations on the combination therapy had a median OS of 13 months, compared to 9 months for monotherapy. Since the patient is enrolled in the trial receiving the combination (ONC201 plus panobinostat), the expected median OS should be 13 months.\n\nI need to check the context for exact quotes. For the dose adjustment: \"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss-of-function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25% from the standard 20 mg/m\u00b2 regimen.\" So 20 mg/m\u00b2 reduced by 25% is 15 mg/m\u00b2. The BSA is 1.0, so the dose per administration is 15 mg, but the question asks for the dose in mg/m\u00b2, which is 15 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nFor survival: \"patients with both H3-K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13 months.\"\n\nSo the adjusted dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 and median OS is 13 months.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\"\n\"patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe adjusted panobinostat dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 administered orally three times per week.

So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for the patient after progression on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context is a medical case study about a 7-year-old boy with DIPG who has specific mutations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the patient's situation. He has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He went through radiation and then a Phase II trial combining panobinostat, ONC201, and temozolomide. But at 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nThe key here is the molecular profile. The context mentions that for tumors with both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations, the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen, which is worse than H3K27M-only tumors. So, the current treatment isn't effective for dual-mutant cases.\n\nLooking at the next options, the trial protocol allowed crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) upon progression, but only if they hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition. The patient hasn't had any ACVR1 inhibitors before, so he's eligible. The ACVR1-specific trial (NCT04556789) reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant patients with manageable side effects.\n\nOption (2) is off-label momelotinib, which is also an ACVR1 inhibitor. But the tumor board favored option (1) because the patient hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition, and the trial data supports LDN-193189's efficacy in this subgroup. The context states the board preferred the Phase I trial over off-label use, likely due to structured monitoring and reported outcomes.\n\nI need to check the proof. The context says: \"the trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1-targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since the patient hasn't had ACVR1 inhibitors, he qualifies. Also, \"the board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38%...\"\n\nSo the answer should be option (1), enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial.

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle. The trial protocol required continued corticosteroid support; due to a documented anaphylaxis to dexamethasone, the patient was switched to methylprednisolone 1\u202fmg/kg/day intravenously, then tapered to oral prednisolone 0.5\u202fmg/kg/day.\n\nInterim efficacy data from the trial (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) showed:\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 12% (partial responses) across all DIPG participants.\n- Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations.\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 9.8\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only, versus 7.3\u202fmonths for the dual\u2011mutant subgroup.\n\nAt the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement and increased FLAIR signal, consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",
