But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about medical details like histone mutations, treatments, and clinical trials.\n\nHmm, the user's question is about geography, specifically the capital of France. But the context given doesn't mention anything related to France's capital. The instructions say I must use the provided context to answer and copy direct quotes. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. \n\nLooking through the context again: it's all medical info on DIPG. No mention of France, capitals, or any geographical data. So there's no quote I can pull from the context to support an answer about Paris being the capital. The rules state that if I can't find a quote, I shouldn't answer, and an empty proof leads to a penalty. \n\nTherefore, I need to point out that the context doesn't provide any information about the capital of France. The answer must strictly come from the given context, which it doesn't. So the proof section will be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So in this case, since there's no relevant quote, I shouldn't provide an answer. But the structure requires the proof and answer tags. However, the instructions specify that empty proof leads to penalty, but if there's no quote, you can't answer. So perhaps the correct response is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nBut the user also says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no quote, I have to follow the structure. However, the problem is that the answer must be based only on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be provided. But the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" which suggests that the model should avoid that. Wait, but in this case, there is no relevant quote. So the correct action is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information. But according to the instructions, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should be that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST prove your answer using the provided context.\" So if the context doesn't have the info, then the answer should reflect that. Let me check the exact instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So if there's no quote, the model shouldn't answer, but the structure requires the tags. However, the model must follow the structure. So perhaps the proof is empty (but that's a penalty), but according to the problem statement, the model must not answer if no quote. Wait, the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the model should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires the answer tag. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the example structure given:\n\nStructure your response exactly like this:\n\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning]\n</tool_call>\n<proof>\n\"[Exact quote from text]\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\n[Final Answer]\n</answer>\n\nBut in this case, there is no quote. So the proof would be empty. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" But the model is supposed to follow the instructions strictly. The user also says \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the model cannot answer, meaning the answer section should state that. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. But the proof would have to support that. However, the context doesn't mention anything about France's capital, so there's no quote to prove that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is that the user is testing if the model sticks to the context. The question is a trick to see if the model answers based on external knowledge. But the instructions say to use only the provided context. So the correct response is to state that the context doesn't contain the information, but since there's no quote about it, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof leads to penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the model should not provide an answer. But the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer tag should say \"The provided context does not contain information about the capital of France.\" But the proof would be empty, which is a penalty. However, according to the problem's rules, the model must follow the structure. So perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, with an empty proof. But the user says empty proof is a penalty, but in this case, it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should recognize that the question is outside the scope of the context and respond accordingly. Let me check the context again. The context is entirely about DIPG, a medical condition. There's no mention of France or capitals. So the correct answer is that the context doesn't provide that information. But how to structure it.\n\nThe instructions say: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the model cannot answer. But the user requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer is \"The question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\" But the proof would be empty, which is a penalty. However, the model has to follow the structure. So the proof is empty, and the answer states that.\n\nBut the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but in this case, it's unavoidable. So the model must proceed with empty proof and state that the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the proof must have an exact quote. If there's none, then the proof is empty, but the answer should reflect that. However, the instructions say \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer section should be empty? But the structure requires the answer tag.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the strict instructions, the correct approach is to have an empty proof and in the answer state that the context does not provide the necessary information. Even though empty proof is a penalty, in this case, it's the correct action because the context doesn't contain the info.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe provided context does not contain any information about the capital of France.

But the context given doesn't mention anything related to France's capital. The instructions say I must use the provided context to answer and copy direct quotes. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. \n\nLooking through the context again: it's all medical info on DIPG. No mention of France, capitals, or any geographical data. So there's no quote I can pull from the context to support an answer about Paris being the capital. The rules state that if I can't find a quote, I shouldn't answer, and an empty proof leads to a penalty. \n\nTherefore, I need to point out that the context doesn't provide any information about the capital of France. The answer must strictly come from the given context, which it doesn't. So the proof section will be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty.

So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So in this case, since there's no relevant quote, I shouldn't provide an answer. But the structure requires the proof and answer tags. However, the instructions specify that empty proof leads to penalty, but if there's no quote, you can't answer. So perhaps the correct response is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nBut the user also says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no quote, I have to follow the structure. However, the problem is that the answer must be based only on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be provided. But the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" which suggests that the model should avoid that. Wait, but in this case, there is no relevant quote. So the correct action is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information. But according to the instructions, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should be that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST prove your answer using the provided context.\" So if the context doesn't have the info, then the answer should reflect that.

Empty proof = Penalty.\" So if there's no quote, the model shouldn't answer, but the structure requires the tags. However, the model must follow the structure. So perhaps the proof is empty (but that's a penalty), but according to the problem statement, the model must not answer if no quote. Wait, the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the model should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires the answer tag. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the example structure given:\n\nStructure your response exactly like this:\n\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning]\n</tool_call>\n<proof>\n\"[Exact quote from text]\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\n[Final Answer]\n</answer>\n\nBut in this case, there is no quote. So the proof would be empty. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" But the model is supposed to follow the instructions strictly. The user also says \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the model cannot answer, meaning the answer section should state that. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. But the proof would have to support that. However, the context doesn't mention anything about France's capital, so there's no quote to prove that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is that the user is testing if the model sticks to the context. The question is a trick to see if the model answers based on external knowledge. But the instructions say to use only the provided context. So the correct response is to state that the context doesn't contain the information, but since there's no quote about it, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof leads to penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the model should not provide an answer. But the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer tag should say \"The provided context does not contain information about the capital of France.\" But the proof would be empty, which is a penalty. However, according to the problem's rules, the model must follow the structure. So perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, with an empty proof. But the user says empty proof is a penalty, but in this case, it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should recognize that the question is outside the scope of the context and respond accordingly. Let me check the context again. The context is entirely about DIPG, a medical condition. There's no mention of France or capitals. So the correct answer is that the context doesn't provide that information. But how to structure it.\n\nThe instructions say: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the model cannot answer. But the user requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer is \"The question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\" But the proof would be empty, which is a penalty. However, the model has to follow the structure. So the proof is empty, and the answer states that.\n\nBut the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but in this case, it's unavoidable. So the model must proceed with empty proof and state that the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the proof must have an exact quote. If there's none, then the proof is empty, but the answer should reflect that. However, the instructions say \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer section should be empty? But the structure requires the answer tag.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the strict instructions, the correct approach is to have an empty proof and in the answer state that the context does not provide the necessary information. Even though empty proof is a penalty, in this case, it's the correct action because the context doesn't contain the info.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe provided context does not contain any information about the capital of France.
