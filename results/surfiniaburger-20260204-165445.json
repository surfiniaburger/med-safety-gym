MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative T2\u2011hyperintense lesion centered in the pons, consistent with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). A stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histology confirmed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling showed:\n\n- H3\u202fK27M mutation (H3F3A) confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n- Co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation.\n- PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6\u2011fold increase by FISH).\n- Germline TP53 R175H pathogenic variant (identified on a cancer predisposition panel).\n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions, completed 4\u202fweeks prior to presentation. At the end of radiation, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (600\u202fmg orally once weekly) and panobinostat (20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly). The trial reported a 6\u2011month overall survival (OS) of 55\u202f% for ONC201 monotherapy and a 12\u2011month OS of 30\u202f% for the combination regimen in H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients.\n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 nausea, managed with supportive care. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated radiographic progression with a 20\u202f% increase in tumor volume and new diffuse enhancement.

Examine the tumor\u2019s molecular alterations that could guide targeted therapy: the tumor harbors PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, which is a known actionable target for PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitors.\n4.

The user is asking about the most appropriate next therapeutic option for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG who's progressed after initial treatment. \n\nFirst, I need to carefully review the context. The patient has a WHO grade IV diffuse midline glioma with H3 K27M mutation, plus ACVR1 mutation, PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, and germline TP53 variant. He completed radiation and tried ONC201 + panobinostat combo, but MRI at week 8 showed 20% tumor growth. \n\nHmm... the key points I notice:\n- Re-irradiation is ruled out due to cumulative dose >60Gy\n- Tumor has PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6-fold)\n- There's a specific trial mentioned: NCT05234567 testing crenolanib for PDGFR\u03b1-amplified pediatric gliomas\n\n*checks context again* Ah! The text explicitly states: \"The patient\u2019s tumor harbors PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFR inhibition. A separate ongoing phase I/II trial (NCT05234567) is evaluating the selective PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitor crenolanib...\" \n\nThis seems crucial. The context directly links the molecular finding (PDGFR\u03b1 amp) to a targeted therapy option. Other options aren't discussed as viable - re-irradiation is \"deemed high-risk\", and the previous combo already failed. \n\n*verifying quotes* Yes, the exact phrase is \"suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFR inhibition\" followed by the trial details. No other targeted options are mentioned for his specific mutations. The ACVR1 mutation isn't tied to any therapy here, and TP53 is germline but not actionable per context.\n\nSo the proof is clear: PDGFR\u03b1 amplification \u2192 crenolanib trial is the only next step discussed.
