                "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the patient is eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat based on the Phase I study criteria mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the eligibility criteria for the Phase I study (NCT05012345) as provided. The context lists four criteria: (1) confirmed H3 K27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. Additionally, it mentions that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use.\n\nNow, checking the patient's details. The molecular profiling confirmed H3 K27M mutation, so criterion (1) is met. The patient received standard radiation (54 Gy) followed by ONC201 and panobinostat, which is systemic therapy. After 5 months, there was progression, so they had progression after radiation and one line of systemic therapy. That covers criterion (2). \n\nNext, criterion (3) is no prior EZH2 inhibitors. The patient was on ONC201 and panobinostat, then switched to dasatinib with ONC201. There's no mention of any EZH2 inhibitor like tazemetostat before, so this should be satisfied. \n\nCriterion (4) is adequate organ function. The context mentions the patient had grade 2 fatigue and grade 1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed. Later, when switching to dasatinib, there's no mention of organ dysfunction. However, the context doesn't explicitly state \"adequate organ function,\" but since they were allowed to switch therapies and the compassionate use note doesn't mention this as an issue, maybe it's assumed. Wait, but the question is about compassionate use eligibility. The Phase I study's criteria include (4), but the compassionate use part says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So maybe the compassionate use has slightly different criteria? Let me check again.\n\nThe context says: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So the compassionate use eligibility specifically requires progression after ONC201-based therapy. The patient did progress after ONC201 plus panobinostat (which is an ONC201-based regimen), then switched to dasatinib. So according to that statement, they should be eligible. \n\nBut wait, the Phase I study's general eligibility includes the four criteria, but the compassionate use part adds that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible. So even if the Phase I study normally requires certain things, the compassionate use is specifically for those who progressed on ONC201. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe Phase I study's eligibility criteria are listed as (1)-(4). Then, separately, it says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use here seems to have its own criteria, which is just having progressed on ONC201-based therapy. But does it still require the other criteria? The problem states \"according to the Phase I study criteria,\" but the compassionate use is mentioned as a separate note by the investigators. \n\nWait, the question is: \"is the patient eligible for compassionate use of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat according to the Phase I study criteria?\" Hmm. The Phase I study's criteria are the four points, but the compassionate use is an additional note. The compassionate use eligibility might be based on the Phase I study's criteria, but the note says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible for compassionate use. So perhaps the compassionate use bypasses some criteria, but the question is whether they meet the Phase I study's criteria for compassionate use.\n\nWait, the exact quote: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use eligibility here is defined as having progressed on ONC201-based therapy. The patient did progress after ONC201 plus panobinostat (which is an ONC201-based regimen), so they meet that condition. \n\nBut let's cross-verify with the Phase I study's eligibility. The Phase I study requires (1) H3 K27M mutation (patient has it), (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy (patient had radiation, then ONC201/panobinostat as first line, then progressed), (3) no prior EZH2 inhibitors (patient hasn't taken any), (4) adequate organ function (context doesn't explicitly say, but maybe assumed since they were on other therapies). However, the compassionate use note specifically says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible, which the patient has. \n\nWait, the question is about compassionate use eligibility according to the Phase I study criteria. The Phase I study's criteria are for the study itself, but compassionate use might have different criteria. However, the context states that the investigators noted that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use. So the compassionate use eligibility is based on that specific criterion. \n\nSo the patient progressed after ONC201-based therapy (ONC201 plus panobinostat), so according to the investigators' note, they are eligible. Therefore, the answer should be yes. \n\nNow, looking for direct quotes to support this. The key part is: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" The patient was on ONC201 plus panobinostat, which is an ONC201-based regimen, and after 5 months, exhibited progression. So the quote directly states that such patients are eligible.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nYes\n</answer>",

                  "context": "A 7\u2011year\u2011old male presented with a 3\u2011month history of progressive ataxia, dysphagia, and new\u2011onset cranial nerve VI palsy. MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04056271) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and imipridone) plus panobinostat (a pan\u2011histone deacetylase inhibitor). The protocol mandated standard focal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) followed by oral ONC201 625\u202fmg once weekly and panobinostat 20\u202fmg orally three times weekly, beginning 2\u202fweeks after radiation completion. \n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed conservatively. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline. The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants (historical median OS for DIPG \u2248\u202f9\u202fmonths) and a 25\u202f% objective response rate (ORR) per RANO criteria. Panobinostat was noted to increase histone H3 acetylation levels by an average of 1.8\u2011fold in tumor tissue samples. \n\nAfter 5\u202fmonths of therapy, the patient exhibited clinical and radiographic progression, with new areas of contrast enhancement and increased tumor size (+15\u202f%). The trial protocol allowed crossover to second\u2011line therapy with dasatinib (70\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily). The patient was switched to dasatinib while continuing ONC201 monotherapy. \n\nSeparately, a Phase\u202fI study (NCT05012345) investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in pediatric high\u2011grade gliomas reported a 40\u202f% response rate specifically in tumors harboring the H3\u202fK27M mutation, provided patients had not previously received an EZH2\u2011targeted agent. Eligibility criteria included: (1) confirmed H3\u202fK27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. The recommended Phase\u202fII dose was 800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily, with manageable toxicity (most common grade\u202f1\u20132 nausea and transient lymphopenia).

But the radiology note mentions it could be high-grade or low-grade, recommending tissue diagnosis.\n\nWait, but DIPG is usually associated with diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, which is WHO grade IV. However, without molecular testing or biopsy, can we confirm the grade? The context states no molecular results are available.

So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy of 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then, later on, there's a mention of a focal re-irradiation boost: 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. The initial dose was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%. The context says the dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the math: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context.\n\nWait, the question says \"adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction\". The context states: \"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\" So the answer for ONC201 is 500 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nLet me double-check the radiation doses. Initial 54 Gy, then later 24 Gy boost. Total 78 Gy. The context says \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy in 12 fractions\". So yes, cumulative is 54 +24 =78.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. Scanning through, nope, only those two. So total radiation is 78 Gy. ONC201 adjusted dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\n\nNow, the proof part requires exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost... 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nSo the answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks\" and \"a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks\"\n\"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\n78\u202fGy total radiation; 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\n</answer>",

The patient tolerated the regimen well for the first six weeks, during which repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume. \n\nAt week\u202f7, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L). Per the trial amendment, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly. \n\nGiven persistent disease progression at week\u202f12, the treating team initiated a second investigational protocol involving the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib. Paxalisib was administered orally at 30\u202fmg once daily without a loading dose. Because the patient had not harbored a BRAF V600E mutation, dabrafenib was not introduced. To augment the anti\u2011tumor effect, a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks, commencing two weeks after paxalisib initiation. \n\nIn the combined cohort of patients receiving the ONC201/panobinostat regimen, the median overall survival was reported as 12\u202fmonths, with a median progression\u2011free survival of 4\u202fmonths. In contrast, the paxalisib monotherapy arm demonstrated a median overall survival of 9\u202fmonths.

                  "analysis": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy of 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then, later on, there's a mention of a focal re-irradiation boost: 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. The initial dose was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%. The context says the dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the math: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context.\n\nWait, the question says \"adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction\". The context states: \"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\" So the answer for ONC201 is 500 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nLet me double-check the radiation doses. Initial 54 Gy, then later 24 Gy boost. Total 78 Gy. The context says \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy in 12 fractions\". So yes, cumulative is 54 +24 =78.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. Scanning through, nope, only those two. So total radiation is 78 Gy. ONC201 adjusted dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\n\nNow, the proof part requires exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost... 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nSo the answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".",

So, the user is asking if the patient is eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat based on the Phase I study criteria mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the eligibility criteria for the Phase I study (NCT05012345) as provided. The context lists four criteria: (1) confirmed H3 K27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. Additionally, it mentions that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use.\n\nNow, checking the patient's details. The molecular profiling confirmed H3 K27M mutation, so criterion (1) is met. The patient received standard radiation (54 Gy) followed by ONC201 and panobinostat, which is systemic therapy. After 5 months, there was progression, so they had progression after radiation and one line of systemic therapy. That covers criterion (2). \n\nNext, criterion (3) is no prior EZH2 inhibitors. The patient was on ONC201 and panobinostat, then switched to dasatinib with ONC201. There's no mention of any EZH2 inhibitor like tazemetostat before, so this should be satisfied. \n\nCriterion (4) is adequate organ function. The context mentions the patient had grade 2 fatigue and grade 1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed. Later, when switching to dasatinib, there's no mention of organ dysfunction. However, the context doesn't explicitly state \"adequate organ function,\" but since they were allowed to switch therapies and the compassionate use note doesn't mention this as an issue, maybe it's assumed. Wait, but the question is about compassionate use eligibility. The Phase I study's criteria include (4), but the compassionate use part says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So maybe the compassionate use has slightly different criteria? Let me check again.\n\nThe context says: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So the compassionate use eligibility specifically requires progression after ONC201-based therapy. The patient did progress after ONC201 plus panobinostat (which is an ONC201-based regimen), then switched to dasatinib. So according to that statement, they should be eligible. \n\nBut wait, the Phase I study's general eligibility includes the four criteria, but the compassionate use part adds that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible. So even if the Phase I study normally requires certain things, the compassionate use is specifically for those who progressed on ONC201. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe Phase I study's eligibility criteria are listed as (1)-(4). Then, separately, it says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use here seems to have its own criteria, which is just having progressed on ONC201-based therapy. But does it still require the other criteria? The problem states \"according to the Phase I study criteria,\" but the compassionate use is mentioned as a separate note by the investigators. \n\nWait, the question is: \"is the patient eligible for compassionate use of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat according to the Phase I study criteria?\" Hmm. The Phase I study's criteria are the four points, but the compassionate use is an additional note. The compassionate use eligibility might be based on the Phase I study's criteria, but the note says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible for compassionate use. So perhaps the compassionate use bypasses some criteria, but the question is whether they meet the Phase I study's criteria for compassionate use.\n\nWait, the exact quote: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use eligibility here is defined as having progressed on ONC201-based therapy. The patient did progress after ONC201 plus panobinostat (which is an ONC201-based regimen), so they meet that condition. \n\nBut let's cross-verify with the Phase I study's eligibility. The Phase I study requires (1) H3 K27M mutation (patient has it), (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy (patient had radiation, then ONC201/panobinostat as first line, then progressed), (3) no prior EZH2 inhibitors (patient hasn't taken any), (4) adequate organ function (context doesn't explicitly say, but maybe assumed since they were on other therapies). However, the compassionate use note specifically says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible, which the patient has. \n\nWait, the question is about compassionate use eligibility according to the Phase I study criteria. The Phase I study's criteria are for the study itself, but compassionate use might have different criteria. However, the context states that the investigators noted that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use. So the compassionate use eligibility is based on that specific criterion. \n\nSo the patient progressed after ONC201-based therapy (ONC201 plus panobinostat), so according to the investigators' note, they are eligible. Therefore, the answer should be yes. \n\nNow, looking for direct quotes to support this. The key part is: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" The patient was on ONC201 plus panobinostat, which is an ONC201-based regimen, and after 5 months, exhibited progression.

MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04056271) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and imipridone) plus panobinostat (a pan\u2011histone deacetylase inhibitor). The protocol mandated standard focal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) followed by oral ONC201 625\u202fmg once weekly and panobinostat 20\u202fmg orally three times weekly, beginning 2\u202fweeks after radiation completion. \n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed conservatively. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline. The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants (historical median OS for DIPG \u2248\u202f9\u202fmonths) and a 25\u202f% objective response rate (ORR) per RANO criteria. Panobinostat was noted to increase histone H3 acetylation levels by an average of 1.8\u2011fold in tumor tissue samples. \n\nAfter 5\u202fmonths of therapy, the patient exhibited clinical and radiographic progression, with new areas of contrast enhancement and increased tumor size (+15\u202f%). The trial protocol allowed crossover to second\u2011line therapy with dasatinib (70\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily).

Eligibility criteria included: (1) confirmed H3\u202fK27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. The recommended Phase\u202fII dose was 800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily, with manageable toxicity (most common grade\u202f1\u20132 nausea and transient lymphopenia).

Then, later on, there's a mention of a focal re-irradiation boost: 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. The initial dose was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%. The context says the dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the math: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context.\n\nWait, the question says \"adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction\". The context states: \"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\" So the answer for ONC201 is 500 mg/m\u00b2.\n\nLet me double-check the radiation doses. Initial 54 Gy, then later 24 Gy boost. Total 78 Gy. The context says \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy in 12 fractions\". So yes, cumulative is 54 +24 =78.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. Scanning through, nope, only those two. So total radiation is 78 Gy. ONC201 adjusted dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\n\nNow, the proof part requires exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost... 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nSo the answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks\" and \"a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks\"\n\"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held.

                "context": "A 7\u2011year\u2011old boy presented with progressive gait instability and cranial nerve VI palsy. MRI revealed a diffusely infiltrating pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in maximal diameter. Histologic examination after stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; BRAF V600E was wild\u2011type. \n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks. After completing radiation, the patient enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating oral ONC201 combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The protocol stipulated ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered once weekly and panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given orally three times weekly. The patient tolerated the regimen well for the first six weeks, during which repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume. \n\nAt week\u202f7, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L). Per the trial amendment, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly. \n\nGiven persistent disease progression at week\u202f12, the treating team initiated a second investigational protocol involving the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib. Paxalisib was administered orally at 30\u202fmg once daily without a loading dose. Because the patient had not harbored a BRAF V600E mutation, dabrafenib was not introduced. To augment the anti\u2011tumor effect, a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks, commencing two weeks after paxalisib initiation. \n\nIn the combined cohort of patients receiving the ONC201/panobinostat regimen, the median overall survival was reported as 12\u202fmonths, with a median progression\u2011free survival of 4\u202fmonths. In contrast, the paxalisib monotherapy arm demonstrated a median overall survival of 9\u202fmonths. The patient\u2019s current performance status is Karnofsky 80\u202f% and he continues on paxalisib with close hematologic monitoring.",
