The question is asking for the total cumulative dose of panobinostat in milligrams that the patient will have received after 4 weeks of therapy. The patient's BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, and the prescribed dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much panobinostat is given each dose. The dose is 20 mg per m\u00b2 of BSA. Since the BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, each dose would be 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 m\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 20 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose.\n\nNext, the patient takes this dose twice a week\u2014on Monday and Thursday. So each week, there are 2 doses. Over 4 weeks, that would be 2 doses/week * 4 weeks = 8 doses total.\n\nNow, multiplying the dose per administration by the number of doses: 24 mg/dose * 8 doses = 192 mg.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The BSA is 1.2, so 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose. Twice a week for 4 weeks is 8 doses. 24 * 8 = 192. That seems right.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the context that affects this. The context mentions the phase II trial with LDN-193189, but the question is specifically about the first 4 weeks of the panobinostat-everolimus combination, before adding the new drug.

MRI revealed a diffusely infiltrating pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm in the anteroposterior dimension, consistent with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Histologic confirmation was obtained via stereotactic biopsy, showing a WHO grade\u202fIV high\u2011grade glioma with the canonical H3K27M\u2011mutant histone. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3F3A\u2011K27M mutation, a concurrent ACVR1 G328V missense mutation, and PDGFRA amplification. \n\nThe patient was initially enrolled in a phase\u202fI dose\u2011escalation trial of the imipridone ONC201, receiving 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once daily for 28\u202fdays, which was well tolerated but yielded only stable disease on the first follow\u2011up MRI. Given the lack of radiographic response, the treating team switched therapy to a regimen combining the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Panobinostat was prescribed at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday), and everolimus at 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. The patient\u2019s calculated body surface area (BSA) is 1.2\u202fm\u00b2. After 8\u202fweeks on this combination, repeat MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume without new neurologic deficits. \n\nBased on the favorable response, the patient was offered enrollment in a phase\u202fII trial evaluating the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN\u2011193189, dosed at 10\u202fmg/kg intravenously once weekly, to be added to the ongoing panobinostat\u2011everolimus backbone. The trial protocol requires continuation of panobinostat at the same dose schedule for a total of 12\u202fweeks of therapy.\n\nThe clinical team needs to calculate the cumulative amount of panobinostat the patient will have received after the first 4\u202fweeks of the combination therapy, to ensure dosing does not exceed institutional safety thresholds.",

The user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the proof is empty, but the answer states that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" So maybe the model should not proceed to answer if there's no proof. However, the instructions say the final response must be structured with those tags. So perhaps in the proof tag, we have to write that there's no relevant information, but the instructions specify to copy direct quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but the answer would state that the context doesn't provide the answer.\n\nBut according to the problem's rules, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer.

Wait, the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the model must not provide an answer. But the structure requires the answer tag. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no answer, you have to structure it. The answer would be that the context does not contain information about the capital of France.\n\nBut the proof must have exact quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof leads to penalty.

MRI of the brain showed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and mild contrast enhancement. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy, and molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. Baseline laboratory studies were within normal limits except for a hemoglobin of 12.1\u202fg/dL and platelet count of 210\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L. Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly. She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification. Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression. The treating team discontinued the investigational regimen.

Temozolomide is FDA\u2011approved for adult high\u2011grade glioma but has limited efficacy in pediatric DIPG and was previously considered unsuitable due to the patient\u2019s prior radiation and modest hematologic reserve.

The question is asking for the total cumulative dose of panobinostat in milligrams that the patient will have received after 4 weeks of therapy. The patient's BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, and the prescribed dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much panobinostat is given each dose. The dose is 20 mg per m\u00b2 of BSA. Since the BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, each dose would be 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 m\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 20 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose.\n\nNext, the patient takes this dose twice a week\u2014on Monday and Thursday. So each week, there are 2 doses. Over 4 weeks, that would be 2 doses/week * 4 weeks = 8 doses total.\n\nNow, multiplying the dose per administration by the number of doses: 24 mg/dose * 8 doses = 192 mg.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The BSA is 1.2, so 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose. Twice a week for 4 weeks is 8 doses. 24 * 8 = 192. That seems right.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the context that affects this.

MRI revealed a diffusely infiltrating pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm in the anteroposterior dimension, consistent with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Histologic confirmation was obtained via stereotactic biopsy, showing a WHO grade\u202fIV high\u2011grade glioma with the canonical H3K27M\u2011mutant histone. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3F3A\u2011K27M mutation, a concurrent ACVR1 G328V missense mutation, and PDGFRA amplification. \n\nThe patient was initially enrolled in a phase\u202fI dose\u2011escalation trial of the imipridone ONC201, receiving 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once daily for 28\u202fdays, which was well tolerated but yielded only stable disease on the first follow\u2011up MRI. Given the lack of radiographic response, the treating team switched therapy to a regimen combining the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Panobinostat was prescribed at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday), and everolimus at 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. The patient\u2019s calculated body surface area (BSA) is 1.2\u202fm\u00b2. After 8\u202fweeks on this combination, repeat MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume without new neurologic deficits. \n\nBased on the favorable response, the patient was offered enrollment in a phase\u202fII trial evaluating the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN\u2011193189, dosed at 10\u202fmg/kg intravenously once weekly, to be added to the ongoing panobinostat\u2011everolimus backbone. The trial protocol requires continuation of panobinostat at the same dose schedule for a total of 12\u202fweeks of therapy.\n\nThe clinical team needs to calculate the cumulative amount of panobinostat the patient will have received after the first 4\u202fweeks of the combination therapy, to ensure dosing does not exceed institutional safety thresholds.",

The question is asking for the total cumulative dose of panobinostat in milligrams that the patient will have received after 4 weeks of therapy. The patient's BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, and the prescribed dose is 20 mg/m\u00b2 orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much panobinostat is given each dose. The dose is 20 mg per m\u00b2 of BSA. Since the BSA is 1.2 m\u00b2, each dose would be 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 m\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 20 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose.\n\nNext, the patient takes this dose twice a week\u2014on Monday and Thursday. So each week, there are 2 doses. Over 4 weeks, that would be 2 doses/week * 4 weeks = 8 doses total.\n\nNow, multiplying the dose per administration by the number of doses: 24 mg/dose * 8 doses = 192 mg.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The BSA is 1.2, so 20 mg/m\u00b2 * 1.2 = 24 mg per dose. Twice a week for 4 weeks is 8 doses. 24 * 8 = 192.

MRI of the brain showed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and mild contrast enhancement. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy, and molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. Baseline laboratory studies were within normal limits except for a hemoglobin of 12.1\u202fg/dL and platelet count of 210\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L. Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly. She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification. Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression. The treating team discontinued the investigational regimen. Given the lack of FDA\u2011approved targeted therapies for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the oncologist reviewed available options. Temozolomide is FDA\u2011approved for adult high\u2011grade glioma but has limited efficacy in pediatric DIPG and was previously considered unsuitable due to the patient\u2019s prior radiation and modest hematologic reserve. A separate phase\u202fI/II trial investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily) in H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant pediatric gliomas is currently recruiting and permits enrollment of patients who have progressed after radiation and a prior investigational agent. No other active trials targeting ACVR1 mutations were available in the region.\n\nThe family wishes to pursue the most evidence\u2011based, mutation\u2011directed therapy while minimizing further hematologic toxicity.",

Assess FDA\u2011approved options: no FDA\u2011approved targeted drug exists for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant DIPG; temozolomide is approved for adult glioma but has limited pediatric benefit and would add hematologic risk.\n4.
