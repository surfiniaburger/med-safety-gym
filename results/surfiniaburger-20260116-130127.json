Molecular profiling showed an H3\u202fK27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 mutation; the MGMT promoter was unmethylated. She was enrolled in a phase\u202fII protocol that combined standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) with concurrent oral panobinostat and an investigational PD\u20111 inhibitor. Panobinostat was prescribed at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once daily, administered orally in the evening. The PD\u20111 inhibitor nivolumab was given at 3\u202fmg/kg intravenously every two weeks. After six weeks of therapy, repeat MRI demonstrated a partial response, defined as a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume. However, laboratory studies showed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L). According to the study protocol, any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity mandates holding panobinostat until platelet recovery, then resuming at a 25\u202f% reduced dose. During the thrombocytopenic episode, the patient was started on oral ketoconazole 200\u202fmg daily for a concurrent fungal infection. The protocol notes that ketoconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and is expected to increase panobinostat systemic exposure (AUC) by approximately 50\u202f% when co\u2011administered. The clinical team must now determine the appropriate panobinostat dose to restart once platelet counts have normalized.",
              "question": "What panobinostat dose (in mg/m\u00b2 per day) should be resumed after platelet recovery, taking into account both the protocol\u2011mandated 25\u202f% dose reduction for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia and the 50\u202f% increase in drug exposure caused by the concurrent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole?",

                "final": "<think>\n1. Identify the original panobinostat dose prescribed in the protocol: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily.\n2. Apply the protocol\u2011mandated dose reduction for grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity: reduce the original dose by 25\u202f%, which yields 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.75\u202f=\u202f15\u202fmg/m\u00b2.\n3. Recognize that ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases panobinostat exposure by 50\u202f%; to maintain the intended exposure after reduction, the dose must be further decreased by the factor 1\u202f/\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f0.5)\u202f=\u202f2/3.\n4. Calculate the adjusted dose: 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2/3\u202f=\u202f10\u202fmg/m\u00b2.\n5.
