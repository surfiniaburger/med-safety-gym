                "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the patient is eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat based on the Phase I study criteria mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the eligibility criteria for the Phase I study (NCT05012345) as provided. The context states four criteria: (1) confirmed H3 K27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function.\n\nNow, checking the patient's details. The patient has a confirmed H3 K27M mutation (from molecular profiling). So criterion 1 is met.\n\nNext, progression after standard radiation and at least one line of systemic therapy. The patient received standard radiation (54 Gy in 30 fractions), then started ONC201 and panobinostat. After 5 months, they showed progression and switched to dasatinib plus ONC201. So they had radiation plus two lines of systemic therapy (first ONC201/panobinostat, then dasatinib/ONC201). Wait, but the criterion says \"progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy.\" The patient progressed after radiation and one line (ONC201/panobinostat), then started second-line. So they did progress after radiation and at least one systemic therapy. So criterion 2 is satisfied.\n\nCriterion 3: no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors. The patient was on ONC201, panobinostat, then dasatinib. None of these are EZH2 inhibitors. Tazemetostat is the EZH2 inhibitor in question, and the patient hasn't taken it before. So yes, no prior exposure. Criterion 3 met.\n\nCriterion 4: adequate organ function. The context mentions that after 5 months, they had progression but doesn't specify organ function. However, the compassionate use part says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" Wait, the Phase I study's eligibility includes adequate organ function, but the compassionate use note says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible. The question is about compassionate use eligibility according to the study criteria. The study's criteria require adequate organ function, but the context doesn't mention the patient's current organ function. However, the compassionate use statement says \"were considered eligible,\" which might imply that the other criteria are met, and perhaps organ function is assumed unless stated otherwise. Wait, the context says: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So maybe the compassionate use bypasses some criteria? Wait, no. The compassionate use is under the Phase I study's criteria. Let me check again.\n\nThe Phase I study's eligibility criteria are listed, and then it says \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use here is part of the study's provision. So if the patient progressed on ONC201-based therapy, they meet the progression criterion (criterion 2), and assuming other criteria are met, they are eligible.\n\nThe patient did progress after ONC201-based regimen (since they were on ONC201 plus panobinostat, then progressed). So according to the note, they are eligible for compassionate use. But need to check all four criteria.\n\nWait, the four criteria are part of the Phase I study, and compassionate use is allowed for those who progressed on ONC201 regimens. The patient has H3 K27M (1), progressed after radiation and systemic therapy (2), no prior EZH2 inhibitors (3). Organ function (4): the context doesn't mention any issues, and since they were on the trial and then switched therapies, it's likely they have adequate organ function. But the context doesn't explicitly state it. However, the compassionate use statement says \"were considered eligible,\" which might mean that the study's investigators have determined that meeting the progression on ONC201 regimen satisfies the criteria, possibly assuming organ function is adequate unless contraindicated. Since the question is based solely on the provided context, and the context says that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use, then the answer would be yes.\n\nWait, the exact quote: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So regardless of other criteria? No, probably in addition to the other criteria. But the compassionate use\n</think>\n",

MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04056271) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and imipridone) plus panobinostat (a pan\u2011histone deacetylase inhibitor). The protocol mandated standard focal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) followed by oral ONC201 625\u202fmg once weekly and panobinostat 20\u202fmg orally three times weekly, beginning 2\u202fweeks after radiation completion. \n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed conservatively. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline. The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants (historical median OS for DIPG \u2248\u202f9\u202fmonths) and a 25\u202f% objective response rate (ORR) per RANO criteria. Panobinostat was noted to increase histone H3 acetylation levels by an average of 1.8\u2011fold in tumor tissue samples. \n\nAfter 5\u202fmonths of therapy, the patient exhibited clinical and radiographic progression, with new areas of contrast enhancement and increased tumor size (+15\u202f%). The trial protocol allowed crossover to second\u2011line therapy with dasatinib (70\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily). The patient was switched to dasatinib while continuing ONC201 monotherapy. \n\nSeparately, a Phase\u202fI study (NCT05012345) investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in pediatric high\u2011grade gliomas reported a 40\u202f% response rate specifically in tumors harboring the H3\u202fK27M mutation, provided patients had not previously received an EZH2\u2011targeted agent. Eligibility criteria included: (1) confirmed H3\u202fK27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. The recommended Phase\u202fII dose was 800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily, with manageable toxicity (most common grade\u202f1\u20132 nausea and transient lymphopenia).

So, the question is whether the patient can continue panobinostat therapy based on the STEM-001 trial protocol and his latest lab values. First, I need to recall the details from the context provided.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, enrolled in the STEM-001 trial. The treatment includes radiation and panobinostat. After three weeks of induction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45), so they reduced the dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and gave a platelet transfusion. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, the MRI is stable, and according to the protocol, continuation is allowed if platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities. His current labs: platelets 58, hemoglobin 12.3, ANC 2.1.\n\nWait, the protocol says after radiation, maintenance is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks post-radiation. But during induction (which is during radiation), it's 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Then, after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia, they switched to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Now, the question is about continuing therapy after the 4-month MRI.\n\nLooking at the protocol details: \"Continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" The current platelet count is 58, which is above 30. Also, the other labs are within normal ranges (ANC 2.1 is above 1.5, so no neutropenia; hemoglobin 12.3 is normal). So, he meets the criteria to continue.\n\nBut what's the dosage now? The initial induction was 20, reduced to 15 twice weekly during radiation. After radiation, the maintenance dose is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, he had a dose reduction during induction. The protocol says after radiation, maintenance starts at 15 once weekly. But since he had a dose reduction during induction, does that affect the maintenance dose?\n\nWait, the context states: \"Maintenance: 15 mg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4 weeks after radiation completion.\" So after radiation ends, maintenance is once weekly. But the patient had a dose reduction during induction (to 15 twice weekly). However, the maintenance phase is separate. But the question is about continuing after the 4-month MRI, which is during the maintenance phase.\n\nWait, the timeline: radiation is 6 weeks. Then maintenance starts 4 weeks after radiation completion. So total time from start: 6 weeks radiation + 4 weeks = 10 weeks before maintenance starts. The 4-month post-diagnosis MRI is at 16 weeks (4 months \u2248 16 weeks). So maintenance would have started around week 10, and now at week 16, they're checking if he can continue.\n\nThe current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction. The dose reduction happened during induction (which is during radiation). But after radiation, the maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. However, the patient had a dose reduction to 15 twice weekly during induction. But once radiation is done, maintenance is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, the thrombocytopenia occurred during induction, and they reduced the dose then. Now, during maintenance, the protocol allows continuation at reduced dose if platelets >30.\n\nWait, the protocol says: \"continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" So the reduced dose here refers to whatever reduced dose they're on. The initial maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. But since he had a prior dose reduction (to 15 twice weekly during induction), but maintenance is once weekly, perhaps the reduced dose for maintenance would still be 15 once weekly, but maybe they need to reduce further?\n\nWait, no.

Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and focal PDGFRA amplification.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter Phase\u202fII trial \"STEM\u2011001\" evaluating the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in combination with standard radiation therapy. The treatment schema was:\n- Radiation: 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks.\n- Panobinostat induction: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly during radiation.\n- Maintenance: 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4\u202fweeks after radiation completion.\n\nTrial interim analysis reported a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths, a 6\u2011month progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 55\u202f%, and grade\u202f3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22\u202f% of participants.\n\nAfter three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia.

So, the question is whether the patient can continue panobinostat therapy based on the STEM-001 trial protocol and his latest lab values. First, I need to recall the details from the context provided.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, enrolled in the STEM-001 trial. The treatment includes radiation and panobinostat. After three weeks of induction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45), so they reduced the dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and gave a platelet transfusion. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, the MRI is stable, and according to the protocol, continuation is allowed if platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities. His current labs: platelets 58, hemoglobin 12.3, ANC 2.1.\n\nWait, the protocol says after radiation, maintenance is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks post-radiation. But during induction (which is during radiation), it's 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Then, after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia, they switched to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Now, the question is about continuing therapy after the 4-month MRI.\n\nLooking at the protocol details: \"Continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" The current platelet count is 58, which is above 30. Also, the other labs are within normal ranges (ANC 2.1 is above 1.5, so no neutropenia; hemoglobin 12.3 is normal). So, he meets the criteria to continue.\n\nBut what's the dosage now? The initial induction was 20, reduced to 15 twice weekly during radiation. After radiation, the maintenance dose is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, he had a dose reduction during induction. The protocol says after radiation, maintenance starts at 15 once weekly. But since he had a dose reduction during induction, does that affect the maintenance dose?\n\nWait, the context states: \"Maintenance: 15 mg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4 weeks after radiation completion.\" So after radiation ends, maintenance is once weekly. But the patient had a dose reduction during induction (to 15 twice weekly). However, the maintenance phase is separate. But the question is about continuing after the 4-month MRI, which is during the maintenance phase.\n\nWait, the timeline: radiation is 6 weeks. Then maintenance starts 4 weeks after radiation completion. So total time from start: 6 weeks radiation + 4 weeks = 10 weeks before maintenance starts. The 4-month post-diagnosis MRI is at 16 weeks (4 months \u2248 16 weeks). So maintenance would have started around week 10, and now at week 16, they're checking if he can continue.\n\nThe current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction. The dose reduction happened during induction (which is during radiation). But after radiation, the maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. However, the patient had a dose reduction to 15 twice weekly during induction. But once radiation is done, maintenance is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, the thrombocytopenia occurred during induction, and they reduced the dose then. Now, during maintenance, the protocol allows continuation at reduced dose if platelets >30.\n\nWait, the protocol says: \"continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" So the reduced dose here refers to whatever reduced dose they're on. The initial maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. But since he had a prior dose reduction (to 15 twice weekly during induction), but maintenance is once weekly, perhaps the reduced dose for maintenance would still be 15 once weekly, but maybe they need to reduce further?\n\nWait, no.

              "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the patient is eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat based on the Phase I study criteria mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the eligibility criteria for the Phase I study (NCT05012345) as provided. The context states four criteria: (1) confirmed H3 K27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function.\n\nNow, checking the patient's details. The patient has a confirmed H3 K27M mutation (from molecular profiling). So criterion 1 is met.\n\nNext, progression after standard radiation and at least one line of systemic therapy. The patient received standard radiation (54 Gy in 30 fractions), then started ONC201 and panobinostat. After 5 months, they showed progression and switched to dasatinib plus ONC201. So they had radiation plus two lines of systemic therapy (first ONC201/panobinostat, then dasatinib/ONC201). Wait, but the criterion says \"progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy.\" The patient progressed after radiation and one line (ONC201/panobinostat), then started second-line. So they did progress after radiation and at least one systemic therapy. So criterion 2 is satisfied.\n\nCriterion 3: no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors. The patient was on ONC201, panobinostat, then dasatinib. None of these are EZH2 inhibitors. Tazemetostat is the EZH2 inhibitor in question, and the patient hasn't taken it before. So yes, no prior exposure. Criterion 3 met.\n\nCriterion 4: adequate organ function. The context mentions that after 5 months, they had progression but doesn't specify organ function. However, the compassionate use part says \"patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" Wait, the Phase I study's eligibility includes adequate organ function, but the compassionate use note says that progression on ONC201 regimens makes them eligible. The question is about compassionate use eligibility according to the study criteria. The study's criteria require adequate organ function, but the context doesn't mention the patient's current organ function. However, the compassionate use statement says \"were considered eligible,\" which might imply that the other criteria are met, and perhaps organ function is assumed unless stated otherwise. Wait, the context says: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So maybe the compassionate use bypasses some criteria? Wait, no. The compassionate use is under the Phase I study's criteria. Let me check again.\n\nThe Phase I study's eligibility criteria are listed, and then it says \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So compassionate use here is part of the study's provision. So if the patient progressed on ONC201-based therapy, they meet the progression criterion (criterion 2), and assuming other criteria are met, they are eligible.\n\nThe patient did progress after ONC201-based regimen (since they were on ONC201 plus panobinostat, then progressed). So according to the note, they are eligible for compassionate use. But need to check all four criteria.\n\nWait, the four criteria are part of the Phase I study, and compassionate use is allowed for those who progressed on ONC201 regimens. The patient has H3 K27M (1), progressed after radiation and systemic therapy (2), no prior EZH2 inhibitors (3). Organ function (4): the context doesn't mention any issues, and since they were on the trial and then switched therapies, it's likely they have adequate organ function. But the context doesn't explicitly state it. However, the compassionate use statement says \"were considered eligible,\" which might mean that the study's investigators have determined that meeting the progression on ONC201 regimen satisfies the criteria, possibly assuming organ function is adequate unless contraindicated. Since the question is based solely on the provided context, and the context says that patients who progressed on ONC201-based regimens are eligible for compassionate use, then the answer would be yes.\n\nWait, the exact quote: \"The investigators noted that patients who had progressed on ONC201-based regimens were considered eligible for compassionate use of tazemetostat.\" So regardless of other criteria?

MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04056271) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and imipridone) plus panobinostat (a pan\u2011histone deacetylase inhibitor). The protocol mandated standard focal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) followed by oral ONC201 625\u202fmg once weekly and panobinostat 20\u202fmg orally three times weekly, beginning 2\u202fweeks after radiation completion. \n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed conservatively. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline. The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants (historical median OS for DIPG \u2248\u202f9\u202fmonths) and a 25\u202f% objective response rate (ORR) per RANO criteria. Panobinostat was noted to increase histone H3 acetylation levels by an average of 1.8\u2011fold in tumor tissue samples. \n\nAfter 5\u202fmonths of therapy, the patient exhibited clinical and radiographic progression, with new areas of contrast enhancement and increased tumor size (+15\u202f%). The trial protocol allowed crossover to second\u2011line therapy with dasatinib (70\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily). The patient was switched to dasatinib while continuing ONC201 monotherapy. \n\nSeparately, a Phase\u202fI study (NCT05012345) investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in pediatric high\u2011grade gliomas reported a 40\u202f% response rate specifically in tumors harboring the H3\u202fK27M mutation, provided patients had not previously received an EZH2\u2011targeted agent. Eligibility criteria included: (1) confirmed H3\u202fK27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. The recommended Phase\u202fII dose was 800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily, with manageable toxicity (most common grade\u202f1\u20132 nausea and transient lymphopenia).

So, the question is whether the patient can continue panobinostat therapy based on the STEM-001 trial protocol and his latest lab values. First, I need to recall the details from the context provided.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, enrolled in the STEM-001 trial. The treatment includes radiation and panobinostat. After three weeks of induction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45), so they reduced the dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and gave a platelet transfusion. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, the MRI is stable, and according to the protocol, continuation is allowed if platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities. His current labs: platelets 58, hemoglobin 12.3, ANC 2.1.\n\nWait, the protocol says after radiation, maintenance is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks post-radiation. But during induction (which is during radiation), it's 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Then, after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia, they switched to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Now, the question is about continuing therapy after the 4-month MRI.\n\nLooking at the protocol details: \"Continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" The current platelet count is 58, which is above 30. Also, the other labs are within normal ranges (ANC 2.1 is above 1.5, so no neutropenia; hemoglobin 12.3 is normal). So, he meets the criteria to continue.\n\nBut what's the dosage now? The initial induction was 20, reduced to 15 twice weekly during radiation. After radiation, the maintenance dose is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, he had a dose reduction during induction. The protocol says after radiation, maintenance starts at 15 once weekly. But since he had a dose reduction during induction, does that affect the maintenance dose?\n\nWait, the context states: \"Maintenance: 15 mg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4 weeks after radiation completion.\" So after radiation ends, maintenance is once weekly. But the patient had a dose reduction during induction (to 15 twice weekly). However, the maintenance phase is separate. But the question is about continuing after the 4-month MRI, which is during the maintenance phase.\n\nWait, the timeline: radiation is 6 weeks. Then maintenance starts 4 weeks after radiation completion. So total time from start: 6 weeks radiation + 4 weeks = 10 weeks before maintenance starts. The 4-month post-diagnosis MRI is at 16 weeks (4 months \u2248 16 weeks). So maintenance would have started around week 10, and now at week 16, they're checking if he can continue.\n\nThe current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction. The dose reduction happened during induction (which is during radiation). But after radiation, the maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. However, the patient had a dose reduction to 15 twice weekly during induction. But once radiation is done, maintenance is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, the thrombocytopenia occurred during induction, and they reduced the dose then. Now, during maintenance, the protocol allows continuation at reduced dose if platelets >30.\n\nWait, the protocol says: \"continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" So the reduced dose here refers to whatever reduced dose they're on. The initial maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. But since he had a prior dose reduction (to 15 twice weekly during induction), but maintenance is once weekly, perhaps the reduced dose for maintenance would still be 15 once weekly, but maybe they need to reduce further?\n\nWait, no. Let's check the exact protocol description. The treatment schema is:\n\n- Radiation: 54 Gy over 6 weeks.\n\n- Panobinostat induction: 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during radiation.\n\n- Maintenance: 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks after radiation.\n\nSo during radiation (induction), it's 20 twice weekly. After radiation, maintenance is 15 once weekly.\n\nThe patient had thrombocytopenia during induction (after 3 weeks of induction), so they reduced the induction dose to 15 twice weekly. Now, after radiation is completed, maintenance should start at\n</think>\n",

Here's one: \"ONC201 demonstrated a 30% objective response rate in patients with H3K27M\u2011mutant diffuse midline glioma.\"\n\nThat's exactly what the question is asking for. The context states that ONC201 has a 30% objective response rate in those patients. I need to make sure there are no other mentions that might contradict or provide different numbers, but I don't see any others. So the answer should be 30%.\n\nNow, following the structure required: first the plan, then the proof with the exact quote, then the answer. The proof must be the exact quote from the context. The answer is based solely on that proof.",
