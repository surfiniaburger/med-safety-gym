Brain MRI demonstrated a diffusely infiltrating, T2\u2011hyperintense pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm without contrast enhancement, consistent with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and focal PDGFRA amplification.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter Phase\u202fII trial \"STEM\u2011001\" evaluating the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in combination with standard radiation therapy. The treatment schema was:\n- Radiation: 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks.\n- Panobinostat induction: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly during radiation.\n- Maintenance: 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4\u202fweeks after radiation completion.\n\nTrial interim analysis reported a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths, a 6\u2011month progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 55\u202f%, and grade\u202f3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22\u202f% of participants.\n\nAfter three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. Management per protocol included a dose reduction of panobinostat to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and a single platelet transfusion, after which the platelet count stabilized at 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month post\u2011diagnosis MRI, the lesion remained stable with no new contrast enhancement. According to the STEM\u2011001 protocol, continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicities have occurred.\n\nThe current laboratory values (obtained 2\u202fweeks after the dose reduction) are:\n- Platelet count: 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L\n- Hemoglobin: 12.3\u202fg/dL\n- Absolute neutrophil count: 2.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L\n\nThe treating oncologist must decide whether the patient may continue panobinostat therapy and, if so, at what dosage.",

Review the patient\u2019s current laboratory values: platelet count is 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, which is above the 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L threshold.\n3. Verify that the highest toxicity recorded was grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia; there is no mention of any grade\u202f4 adverse event.\n4. Since both criteria are satisfied, the patient is eligible to continue panobinostat.\n5. Determine the appropriate dose: after the grade\u202f3 event the protocol called for a reduction to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during induction, and the maintenance phase is 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly. The patient is now beyond the induction period (4\u202fmonths post\u2011diagnosis) and should be on the maintenance schedule.\n6.

Brain MRI demonstrated a diffusely infiltrating, T2\u2011hyperintense pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm without contrast enhancement, consistent with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and focal PDGFRA amplification.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter Phase\u202fII trial \"STEM\u2011001\" evaluating the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in combination with standard radiation therapy. The treatment schema was:\n- Radiation: 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks.\n- Panobinostat induction: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly during radiation.\n- Maintenance: 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4\u202fweeks after radiation completion.\n\nTrial interim analysis reported a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths, a 6\u2011month progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 55\u202f%, and grade\u202f3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22\u202f% of participants.\n\nAfter three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. Management per protocol included a dose reduction of panobinostat to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and a single platelet transfusion, after which the platelet count stabilized at 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month post\u2011diagnosis MRI, the lesion remained stable with no new contrast enhancement.

Review the patient\u2019s current laboratory values: platelet count is 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, which is above the 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L threshold.\n3. Verify that the highest toxicity recorded was grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia; there is no mention of any grade\u202f4 adverse event.\n4. Since both criteria are satisfied, the patient is eligible to continue panobinostat.\n5. Determine the appropriate dose: after the grade\u202f3 event the protocol called for a reduction to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during induction, and the maintenance phase is 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly. The patient is now beyond the induction period (4\u202fmonths post\u2011diagnosis) and should be on the maintenance schedule.\n6.
