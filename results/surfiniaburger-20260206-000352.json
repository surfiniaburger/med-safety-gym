MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 3.5 cm with classic T2 hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement. Histone H3 K27M mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and an additional ACVR1 G328V mutation was identified. Germline testing showed a heterozygous TP53 R175H variant. He completed standard focal radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) over six weeks. Two weeks after completing radiation, he was enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of ONC201 and everolimus for H3 K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The trial protocol specified ONC201 625\u202fmg orally once weekly and everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. At the 8\u2011week safety assessment, laboratory studies demonstrated a platelet count of 82\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0). No other hematologic toxicities were noted. MRI at the same visit showed a 30\u202f% reduction in the T2 hyperintense tumor volume compared with baseline, and the patient\u2019s neurologic status remained stable. The trial\u2019s interim report indicated an overall response rate of 25\u202f% in H3 K27M\u2011mutated DIPG, a median progression\u2011free survival of 5.2\u202fmonths, and a median overall survival of 9.8\u202fmonths.

The user is asking for the recommended radiation dose in Gy for a 7-year-old child diagnosed with what seems to be a diffuse midline glioma, specifically H3-K27M-mutant, based on the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard treatment protocols for DIPG or diffuse midline glioma. From what I remember, DIPG is a type of diffuse midline glioma often found in the pons, and the standard treatment is radiation therapy. The typical dose I've heard about is 54 to 60 Gy, but I need to check if the context provides any specific information.\n\nLooking at the context given: The MRI suggests DIPG, and the pathology reports mention high-grade glioma, IDH-wildtype, and possible H3-K27M mutation. However, molecular testing wasn't done due to insufficient tissue. The question is about the recommended radiation dose.\n\nWait, the context doesn't mention anything about treatment plans or radiation doses. The user says, \"No treatment plan has been documented in the chart.\" So the context provided doesn't include information on the recommended dose. The question is asking for the standard dose, but according to the instructions, I must use only the provided context to answer. Since the context doesn't specify the dose, I can't pull a quote from it. The user's instructions say that if I can't find a quote, I cannot answer, and an empty proof leads to a penalty.\n\nSo, even though I might know that 54-60 Gy is standard, the context here doesn't state that. The context only describes the diagnosis and lack of treatment documentation. Therefore, there's no quote in the context about the radiation dose.
