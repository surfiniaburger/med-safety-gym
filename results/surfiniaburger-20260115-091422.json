He received standard focal radiation therapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) followed by a tapering course of dexamethasone. Four weeks after completing radiation, MRI demonstrated stable disease but persistent pontine enlargement. The patient was then enrolled in a phase\u202f1 open\u2011label trial evaluating the combination of the dopamine receptor D2 antagonist ONC201 and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. He was started on ONC201 625\u202fmg taken orally once weekly and everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given daily. At the 8\u2011week assessment, contrast\u2011enhanced MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in the volume of the pontine lesion compared with baseline, meeting radiographic criteria for a partial response. However, the same MRI also revealed new ventricular enlargement and the child developed worsening headache, nausea, and intermittent vomiting consistent with symptomatic hydrocephalus. Lumbar puncture was performed; cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells. The trial protocol reports an overall response rate of 15\u202f% and a median progression\u2011free survival of 4.2\u202fmonths for participants receiving this regimen. The investigators recommend continuing the study drugs in patients who achieve radiographic response, provided that adverse events are managed appropriately.",
