MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm, hyperintense on T2\u2011weighted images, with no clear enhancement. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) classified histologically as a WHO grade\u202fIV high\u2011grade glioma. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3K27M\u2011mutant histone H3.3 (H3F3A) alteration and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V missense mutation. \n\nStandard therapy was initiated with focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with temozolomide (75\u202fmg/m\u00b2/day) for 6\u202fweeks; however, repeat MRI at week\u202f6 showed no radiographic improvement and the patient\u2019s neurological symptoms continued to worsen. \n\nGiven the refractory nature of his disease, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the oral small\u2011molecule ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and TRAIL pathway activator) in combination with the ongoing radiation regimen. The trial protocol stipulates ONC201 at a dose of 625\u202fmg administered orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday) throughout the radiation course and for a planned total duration of 12\u202fmonths. \n\nAt the 6\u2011week assessment, contrast\u2011enhanced MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline, meeting the trial\u2019s partial response criteria. The patient\u2019s clinical status also improved, with regained ability to ambulate short distances and a reduction in dysphagia. However, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L) attributed to ONC201, while white\u2011blood\u2011cell and hemoglobin levels remained within normal limits.

A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle.

Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L).

Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3K27M\u2011mutant histone H3.3 (H3F3A) alteration and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V missense mutation. \n\nStandard therapy was initiated with focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with temozolomide (75\u202fmg/m\u00b2/day) for 6\u202fweeks; however, repeat MRI at week\u202f6 showed no radiographic improvement and the patient\u2019s neurological symptoms continued to worsen. \n\nGiven the refractory nature of his disease, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the oral small\u2011molecule ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and TRAIL pathway activator) in combination with the ongoing radiation regimen. The trial protocol stipulates ONC201 at a dose of 625\u202fmg administered orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday) throughout the radiation course and for a planned total duration of 12\u202fmonths. \n\nAt the 6\u2011week assessment, contrast\u2011enhanced MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline, meeting the trial\u2019s partial response criteria.
