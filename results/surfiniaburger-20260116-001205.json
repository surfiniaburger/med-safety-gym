Brain MRI demonstrated a diffusely infiltrating, T2\u2011hyperintense pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm without contrast enhancement, consistent with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and focal PDGFRA amplification.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter Phase\u202fII trial \"STEM\u2011001\" evaluating the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in combination with standard radiation therapy. The treatment schema was:\n- Radiation: 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks.\n- Panobinostat induction: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly during radiation.\n- Maintenance: 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once weekly beginning 4\u202fweeks after radiation completion.\n\nTrial interim analysis reported a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths, a 6\u2011month progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 55\u202f%, and grade\u202f3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22\u202f% of participants.\n\nAfter three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. Management per protocol included a dose reduction of panobinostat to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and a single platelet transfusion, after which the platelet count stabilized at 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month post\u2011diagnosis MRI, the lesion remained stable with no new contrast enhancement.

              "context": "Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive pontine tumor that primarily affects children. It is characterized by a midline location within the pons and a poor prognosis due to its infiltrative nature. Molecular studies have identified the H3K27M mutation as a hallmark of DIPG, driving epigenetic dysregulation. Standard treatment options are limited; radiation therapy provides temporary symptom relief, while chemotherapy has shown minimal benefit. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating novel targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for patients with this disease.",
