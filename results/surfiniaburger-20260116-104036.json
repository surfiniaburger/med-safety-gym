It is characterized by a diffuse infiltration of the brainstem, making surgical resection impossible. The median overall survival for patients with DIPG remains less than 12 months despite radiation therapy. Recent studies have identified the H3K27M mutation as a hallmark genetic alteration in the majority of DIPG cases. Clinical trials are exploring the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapy to improve outcomes. Standard of care currently involves focal radiation to alleviate symptoms and temporarily improve neurological function.",
