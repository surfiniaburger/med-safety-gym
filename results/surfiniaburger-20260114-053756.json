MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm, hyperintense on T2, with minimal contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling showed an H3\u2011K27M mutation, PDGFRA amplification (copy number 7), and a germline MLH1 pathogenic variant consistent with mismatch\u2011repair deficiency (MMR\u2011D). \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII DIPG\u2011ONC201 trial (NCT04534567). The protocol mandated focal conformal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered twice weekly, starting on day\u202f1 of radiation. After 6\u202fweeks of combined therapy, MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, and the patient\u2019s neurological exam improved. However, at month\u202f9 post\u2011diagnosis (3\u202fmonths after completing radiation), repeat imaging showed new contrast\u2011enhancing foci and increased T2 signal, indicating disease progression despite ongoing ONC201 (which was continued at the same dose). \n\nThe trial\u2019s historical control arm (radiation\u202f+\u202ftemozolomide) reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths, whereas the ONC201 arm showed a median OS of 18\u202fmonths (p\u202f=\u202f0.04). Common adverse events in the ONC201 arm included mild nausea (grade\u202f1) and transient elevation of liver enzymes (grade\u202f2), with no grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicities. \n\nGiven the progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board reviewed salvage options. The board noted that the patient\u2019s tumor harbors PDGFRA amplification, suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFRA inhibitors (e.g., dasatinib, crenolanib). Additionally, the germline MLH1 mutation renders the tumor microsatellite\u2011instability\u2011high (MSI\u2011H), a biomarker for responsiveness to PD\u20111 blockade. Current FDA approvals allow pembrolizumab for MSI\u2011H solid tumors irrespective of histology. Re\u2011irradiation was considered but deemed high\u2011risk due to cumulative dose constraints. The board recommended enrollment in a PD\u20111 inhibitor trial or compassionate use of pembrolizumab, with close monitoring of neurologic status and repeat imaging at 8\u2011week intervals.",

MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm, hyperintense on T2, with minimal contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling showed an H3\u2011K27M mutation, PDGFRA amplification (copy number 7), and a germline MLH1 pathogenic variant consistent with mismatch\u2011repair deficiency (MMR\u2011D). \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII DIPG\u2011ONC201 trial (NCT04534567). The protocol mandated focal conformal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered twice weekly, starting on day\u202f1 of radiation. After 6\u202fweeks of combined therapy, MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, and the patient\u2019s neurological exam improved. However, at month\u202f9 post\u2011diagnosis (3\u202fmonths after completing radiation), repeat imaging showed new contrast\u2011enhancing foci and increased T2 signal, indicating disease progression despite ongoing ONC201 (which was continued at the same dose). \n\nThe trial\u2019s historical control arm (radiation\u202f+\u202ftemozolomide) reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths, whereas the ONC201 arm showed a median OS of 18\u202fmonths (p\u202f=\u202f0.04). Common adverse events in the ONC201 arm included mild nausea (grade\u202f1) and transient elevation of liver enzymes (grade\u202f2), with no grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicities. \n\nGiven the progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board reviewed salvage options. The board noted that the patient\u2019s tumor harbors PDGFRA amplification, suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFRA inhibitors (e.g., dasatinib, crenolanib). Additionally, the germline MLH1 mutation renders the tumor microsatellite\u2011instability\u2011high (MSI\u2011H), a biomarker for responsiveness to PD\u20111 blockade. Current FDA approvals allow pembrolizumab for MSI\u2011H solid tumors irrespective of histology. Re\u2011irradiation was considered but deemed high\u2011risk due to cumulative dose constraints. The board recommended enrollment in a PD\u20111 inhibitor trial or compassionate use of pembrolizumab, with close monitoring of neurologic status and repeat imaging at 8\u2011week intervals.",
