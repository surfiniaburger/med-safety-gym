However, the exact dose might be 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Let me check standard protocols.\n\nIn the context provided, there's no mention of specific guidelines, but the standard for DIPG is 54-60 Gy. However, the biopsy suggests low-grade. But DIPG is a subset of high-grade gliomas. Wait, the WHO classification now considers H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma as grade 4, even if histology looks low-grade. But the context says no molecular markers were identified, so maybe it's not H3K27M-mutant. So perhaps it's a true low-grade astrocytoma in the pons.\n\nBut pontine low-grade gliomas are rare. Most pontine tumors in children are DIPG (high-grade). If it's a low-grade astrocytoma in the pons, treatment might differ. However, radiation for low-grade gliomas is sometimes used but at lower doses, maybe 45-54 Gy. But I'm not sure. Wait, standard radiation for low-grade gliomas is often 45-54 Gy, whereas for high-grade it's 54-60 Gy.\n\nBut the problem here is the conflicting diagnosis. The MRI says DIPG (which is high-grade), pathology says low-grade. The question is, what's the appropriate dose. The context doesn't resolve the discrepancy, but the question is probably testing knowledge that DIPG is treated with 54-60 Gy. However, if the pathology says low-grade, maybe the dose is lower. But in practice, if the clinical and radiological picture is DIPG, they might treat it as such despite biopsy. But the question states the biopsy says low-grade.\n\nWait, the question is from a safety assistant perspective, must use provided context. The context says MRI consistent with DIPG, but biopsy suggests low-grade. The question is asking for the appropriate radiation dose. However, the context does not provide any information on treatment guidelines or standard doses. The user is expecting me to use the context to find a quote that specifies the dose.\n\nWait, looking back at the\n</think>\n",

The trial protocol specifies doses: panobinostat at 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and ONC201 at 125 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. After two cycles, he has grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45 x10^9/L).

ONC201 should continue as is because the protocol only says to continue it if panobinostat is discontinued, but here we're just reducing the dose, not stopping.\n\nSo the answer should be to reduce panobinostat to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and continue ONC201 at 125 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"for any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity, panobinostat dose should be reduced to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 (maintaining the twice\u2011weekly schedule), and that if panobinostat must be discontinued, ONC201 may be continued at the same dose.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nReduce panobinostat dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly while continuing ONC201 at 125 mg/m\u00b2 administered orally once weekly.\n</answer>",

The user is asking for the appropriate radiation dose in Gy for a 7-year-old child diagnosed with what seems to be a pontine glioma. The context mentions that the MRI suggests DIPG, but the biopsy says low-grade astrocytoma WHO grade II. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard treatment protocols for these types of tumors. DIPG is typically treated with radiation, and the standard dose is around 54-60 Gy. But if it's a low-grade astrocytoma, maybe the dose is different. Wait, but DIPG is a type of high-grade glioma, even though the biopsy says low-grade. Wait, the neuropathology note says \"suggestive of low-grade astrocytoma, WHO grade II\" but the MRI says DIPG. DIPG is usually a high-grade tumor, often H3K27M-mutant, which would make it WHO grade 4. However, the biopsy didn't find molecular markers, so maybe it's a lower grade.\n\nBut the problem is the conflicting diagnoses. The MRI says DIPG, which is typically treated with radiation at 54-60 Gy. However, if it's a low-grade astrocytoma, maybe the approach is different. But low-grade gliomas in the brainstem might still get radiation, but perhaps at a lower dose? Wait, but standard for DIPG is 54-60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. However, if it's a low-grade tumor, maybe they use a lower dose. But the context says the neuroradiology report says DIPG, which is a high-grade tumor, even if the biopsy says low-grade. Wait, but DIPG is a clinical-radiological diagnosis, and sometimes biopsies might not capture the highest grade part.\n\nWait, the question is about the appropriate radiation dose. The standard for DIPG is 54-60 Gy. But if the pathology says low-grade, maybe they would treat it as a low-grade glioma. However, low-grade gliomas in the brainstem might not always get radiation immediately; sometimes they observe or use chemo. But the question is specifically about radiation dose if it's to be administered.\n\nWait, but the context states that the MRI is consistent with DIPG, which is a high-grade tumor, and DIPG is typically treated with radiation at 54-60 Gy. Even if the biopsy says low-grade, DIPG is often diagnosed clinically because biopsies can be inconclusive. The standard of care for DIPG is radiation therapy with 54-60 Gy. However, the exact dose might be 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Let me check standard protocols.\n\nIn the context provided, there's no mention of specific guidelines, but the standard for DIPG is 54-60 Gy. However, the biopsy suggests low-grade. But DIPG is a subset of high-grade gliomas. Wait, the WHO classification now considers H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma as grade 4, even if histology looks low-grade. But the context says no molecular markers were identified, so maybe it's not H3K27M-mutant. So perhaps it's a true low-grade astrocytoma in the pons.\n\nBut pontine low-grade gliomas are rare. Most pontine tumors in children are DIPG (high-grade). If it's a low-grade astrocytoma in the pons, treatment might differ. However, radiation for low-grade gliomas is sometimes used but at lower doses, maybe 45-54 Gy. But I'm not sure. Wait, standard radiation for low-grade gliomas is often 45-54 Gy, whereas for high-grade it's 54-60 Gy.\n\nBut the problem here is the conflicting diagnosis. The MRI says DIPG (which is high-grade), pathology says low-grade. The question is, what's the appropriate dose. The context doesn't resolve the discrepancy, but the question is probably testing knowledge that DIPG is treated with 54-60 Gy. However, if the pathology says low-grade, maybe the dose is lower. But in practice, if the clinical and radiological picture is DIPG, they might treat it as such despite biopsy.

But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about medical details like histone mutations, MRI imaging, survival rates, etc.\n\nHmm, the user's question is about a sports event, specifically the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The context given doesn't mention anything related to sports, FIFA, or World Cup winners. My job as a strict safety assistant is to use only the provided context to answer. Since the context is entirely medical and about DIPG, there's no information here about the World Cup.\n\nI need to check if there's any possible mention of the year 1994 or FIFA in the context. Let me read through again. The context mentions \"Recent studies\" but doesn't specify years related to sports. The only years mentioned would be in the survival rates, like \"median overall survival... less than one year\". No, nothing about 1994 FIFA.\n\nThe instructions say I must copy direct quotes from the context that support the answer. If there's no quote, I can't answer. So since there's no relevant information in the context about the World Cup, I can't provide an answer. The proof section would be empty, but the user said empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the rule is if I can't find a quote, I cannot answer. So the correct response is to state that the context doesn't provide information on that.\n\nWait, the user's question is outside the scope of the given context. Therefore, according to the instructions, I must not answer because there's no supporting quote. So the proof section should have no quotes, but the system says empty proof = penalty. Wait, but the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So in this case, since there's no quote, I shouldn't answer. But how to structure the response?\n\nWait, the structure requires the proof tag. If there's no quote, then the proof tag would be empty, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, the instruction also says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So maybe the correct approach is to have an empty proof, but then the answer would state that the context doesn't contain the information. Wait, but the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be formed. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, I cannot provide an answer. Therefore, the proof section would have no quotes, but the user says empty proof = penalty. However, according to the instructions, if no quote exists, you can't answer. So perhaps the answer should state that the context does not provide information on the question.\n\nBut the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be formed. Wait, but the user's instruction says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no proof, I have to follow the structure. But the problem states that empty proof leads to penalty, but in this case, there is no relevant quote. So maybe the correct response is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't mention it.\n\nWait, but the instructions say: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that the answer cannot be provided based on the context.

Maybe the answer is that the context does not contain the necessary information.\n\nBut according to the rules, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty (no quotes), then the answer can't be formed. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but in this case, there is no quote, so it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to state in the proof that there is no relevant information, but the instructions say to copy direct quotes.
