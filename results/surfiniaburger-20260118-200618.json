The MRI shows a diffuse infiltrative lesion in the pons with mild contrast enhancement.

MRI of the brain showed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and mild contrast enhancement. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy, and molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. Baseline laboratory studies were within normal limits except for a hemoglobin of 12.1\u202fg/dL and platelet count of 210\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L. Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly. She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification. Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression. The treating team discontinued the investigational regimen. Given the lack of FDA\u2011approved targeted therapies for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the oncologist reviewed available options. Temozolomide is FDA\u2011approved for adult high\u2011grade glioma but has limited efficacy in pediatric DIPG and was previously considered unsuitable due to the patient\u2019s prior radiation and modest hematologic reserve. A separate phase\u202fI/II trial investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily) in H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant pediatric gliomas is currently recruiting and permits enrollment of patients who have progressed after radiation and a prior investigational agent.

So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy: 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then later, when there's persistent disease progression at week 12, they did a focal re-irradiation boost of 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those two together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. Initially, it was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the trial amendment says ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%, adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the numbers. A 20% reduction from 625: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context which states \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\"\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. The initial 54 Gy and then the 24 Gy boost. No other radiation mentioned. So total is 78 Gy. And the adjusted ONC201 dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. The answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\nNow, I need to check the proof by finding exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% [...] adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nYes, those quotes are in the context. So the proof should include those exact lines. Then the answer is as calculated.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks\"\n\"focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks\"\n\"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held.

Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; BRAF V600E was wild\u2011type. \n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks. After completing radiation, the patient enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating oral ONC201 combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The protocol stipulated ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered once weekly and panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given orally three times weekly. The patient tolerated the regimen well for the first six weeks, during which repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume. \n\nAt week\u202f7, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L).

Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly. \n\nGiven persistent disease progression at week\u202f12, the treating team initiated a second investigational protocol involving the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib. Paxalisib was administered orally at 30\u202fmg once daily without a loading dose. Because the patient had not harbored a BRAF V600E mutation, dabrafenib was not introduced. To augment the anti\u2011tumor effect, a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks, commencing two weeks after paxalisib initiation. \n\nIn the combined cohort of patients receiving the ONC201/panobinostat regimen, the median overall survival was reported as 12\u202fmonths, with a median progression\u2011free survival of 4\u202fmonths.

So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy: 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then later, when there's persistent disease progression at week 12, they did a focal re-irradiation boost of 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those two together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. Initially, it was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the trial amendment says ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%, adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the numbers. A 20% reduction from 625: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context which states \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\"\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. The initial 54 Gy and then the 24 Gy boost. No other radiation mentioned. So total is 78 Gy. And the adjusted ONC201 dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. The answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\nNow, I need to check the proof by finding exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% [...] adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nYes, those quotes are in the context. So the proof should include those exact lines.

The key points here are the conflicting reports from the neuropathology service.\n\nFirst, Report A says there's strong nuclear staining for H3 K27M, which points to diffuse midline glioma, H3-K27-altered. That would mean it's H3-K27-M mutated. But Report B says methylation profiling is inconclusive and the H3 K27M immunostain is negative, suggesting high-grade astrocytoma without the mutation. So there's a contradiction between the two reports.\n\nThe question is whether the tumor is H3-K27-M mutated or wild-type and if it qualifies for the standard DIPG protocol. DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma) typically refers to tumors in the pons that are H3 K27M-mutant. The standard protocol for DIPG usually applies to those with the H3 K27M mutation.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided. The user says no further molecular testing results are given. So we have two conflicting reports. Report A positive for H3 K27M, Report B negative. The problem is that the answer must be based solely on the provided context and using direct quotes.\n\nThe user instructions say that if I can't find a quote supporting the answer, I can't answer. So I need to check if there's a definitive statement in the context. But both reports are presented without resolution. The context states: \"Report A... consistent with diffuse midline glioma, H3-K27-altered.\" and \"Report B... H3 K27M immunostain is negative... high-grade astrocytoma without the H3-K27-M mutation.\"\n\nSince there's a conflict and no additional info, the context doesn't resolve which report is correct. The question asks for the molecular subtype, but the context provides contradictory information. Therefore, based on the given context, it's impossible to determine definitively whether it's mutated or wild-type. \n\nThe answer must rely on the proof from direct quotes. However, both quotes contradict each other. The user's instruction says if I can't find a quote that supports the answer, I can't answer. Wait, but the proof section requires exact quotes. So maybe I need to present both quotes as proof, but the answer would state that it's inconclusive.\n\nWait, the problem says \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" But in this case, there are quotes, but they conflict. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's inconclusive based on the provided context.\n\nLooking at the context again: \"No further molecular testing results are provided, and the oncology team\u2019s treatment plan is not described in the record.\" So there's no resolution given. Therefore, the molecular subtype cannot be determined from the context, and thus it's unclear if it qualifies for DIPG protocol, which requires H3 K27M mutation.\n\nSo the answer should state that due to conflicting reports and no conclusive evidence, the molecular subtype is uncertain, and therefore it doesn't definitively qualify for the standard DIPG protocol which requires H3 K27M mutation.\n\nNow, checking for exact quotes to put in the proof. The relevant parts are:\n\nReport A: \"Immunohistochemistry shows strong nuclear staining for H3 K27M, consistent with a diffuse midline glioma, H3\u2011K27\u2011altered.\"\n\nReport B: \"Methylation profiling is inconclusive and H3 K27M immunostain is negative; the findings are more suggestive of a high\u2011grade astrocytoma without the H3\u2011K27\u2011M mutation.\"\n\nAlso, \"No further molecular testing results are provided...\"\n\nSo the proof would include these quotes.

If the subtype is uncertain, then it wouldn't qualify because the protocol requires the mutation. So the answer would be that it's inconclusive, hence doesn't qualify.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy: 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then later, when there's persistent disease progression at week 12, they did a focal re-irradiation boost of 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those two together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. Initially, it was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the trial amendment says ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%, adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the numbers. A 20% reduction from 625: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context which states \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\"\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. The initial 54 Gy and then the 24 Gy boost. No other radiation mentioned. So total is 78 Gy. And the adjusted ONC201 dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. The answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\nNow, I need to check the proof by finding exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% [...] adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nYes, those quotes are in the context. So the proof should include those exact lines. Then the answer is as calculated.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions (1.8\u202fGy per fraction) over six weeks\"\n\"focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks\"\n\"the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held.

The patient tolerated the regimen well for the first six weeks, during which repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume. \n\nAt week\u202f7, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L). Per the trial amendment, the ONC201 dose was reduced by 20\u202f% while panobinostat was held. Consequently, the ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500\u202fmg/m\u00b2 weekly. \n\nGiven persistent disease progression at week\u202f12, the treating team initiated a second investigational protocol involving the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib. Paxalisib was administered orally at 30\u202fmg once daily without a loading dose. Because the patient had not harbored a BRAF V600E mutation, dabrafenib was not introduced. To augment the anti\u2011tumor effect, a focal re\u2011irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24\u202fGy in 12 fractions (2\u202fGy per fraction) over two weeks, commencing two weeks after paxalisib initiation. \n\nIn the combined cohort of patients receiving the ONC201/panobinostat regimen, the median overall survival was reported as 12\u202fmonths, with a median progression\u2011free survival of 4\u202fmonths. In contrast, the paxalisib monotherapy arm demonstrated a median overall survival of 9\u202fmonths. The patient\u2019s current performance status is Karnofsky 80\u202f% and he continues on paxalisib with close hematologic monitoring.",

                "analysis": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking for two things: the total cumulative radiation dose the patient has received and the adjusted weekly dose of ONC201 after the dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the radiation doses. The initial management mentions focal conformal radiotherapy: 54 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks. Then later, when there's persistent disease progression at week 12, they did a focal re-irradiation boost of 24 Gy in 12 fractions over two weeks. So adding those two together: 54 + 24 = 78 Gy total. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the ONC201 dose adjustment. Initially, it was 625 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. At week 7, due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the trial amendment says ONC201 dose was reduced by 20%, adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. Let me check the numbers. A 20% reduction from 625: 20% of 625 is 125, so 625 - 125 = 500. Yep, that matches the context which states \"ONC201 dose was adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly.\"\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no other radiation doses mentioned. The initial 54 Gy and then the 24 Gy boost. No other radiation mentioned. So total is 78 Gy. And the adjusted ONC201 dose is 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly. The answer should be \"78 Gy total radiation; 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly ONC201\".\n\nNow, I need to check the proof by finding exact quotes. For radiation: \"focal conformal radiotherapy delivered to a total dose of 54 Gy\" and \"focal re-irradiation boost to the residual tumor was delivered: 24 Gy\". For ONC201: \"ONC201 dose was reduced by 20% [...] adjusted to 500 mg/m\u00b2 weekly\".\n\nYes, those quotes are in the context. So the proof should include those exact lines. Then the answer is as calculated.",
