Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u2011K27M mutation (H3F3A) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fI/II trial NCT04212345 evaluating the oral small\u2011molecule imipridone ONC201 in combination with standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions). The trial protocol specified an 8\u2011week induction phase: ONC201 625\u202fmg orally once weekly (approximately 15\u202fmg/kg for a 42\u2011kg child) administered concurrently with radiotherapy. Following induction, patients could enter a maintenance phase. Eligibility for dose escalation to 1250\u202fmg weekly (\u224830\u202fmg/kg) required a radiographic partial response (\u226525\u202f% reduction in T2\u2011signal volume) and absence of any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 treatment\u2011related adverse event per CTCAE v5.0. \n\nDuring induction, the patient completed radiotherapy without interruption.

Brain MRI revealed a diffusely infiltrating pontine lesion measuring 4.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.5\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and minimal enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u2011K27M mutation (H3F3A) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fI/II trial NCT04212345 evaluating the oral small\u2011molecule imipridone ONC201 in combination with standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions). The trial protocol specified an 8\u2011week induction phase: ONC201 625\u202fmg orally once weekly (approximately 15\u202fmg/kg for a 42\u2011kg child) administered concurrently with radiotherapy. Following induction, patients could enter a maintenance phase. Eligibility for dose escalation to 1250\u202fmg weekly (\u224830\u202fmg/kg) required a radiographic partial response (\u226525\u202f% reduction in T2\u2011signal volume) and absence of any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 treatment\u2011related adverse event per CTCAE v5.0. \n\nDuring induction, the patient completed radiotherapy without interruption. Serial MRIs at weeks 4 and 8 showed a 28\u202f% reduction in tumor volume and stable diffusion metrics. She experienced only grade\u202f1 nausea and grade\u202f2 transient headache, both resolved with supportive care. No laboratory abnormalities of grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 were observed. \n\nThe trial\u2019s interim analysis (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) reported that among 23 pediatric participants, 9 (39\u202f%) achieved a partial response, and all 9 entered the maintenance phase at the escalated dose of 1250\u202fmg weekly. Median progression\u2011free survival for the escalated cohort was 8.5\u202fmonths versus 5.2\u202fmonths for those who remained on the induction dose. No new safety signals were identified at the higher dose; the most common grade\u202f3 adverse event was isolated neutropenia in 2 patients, which resolved after dose reduction.",
