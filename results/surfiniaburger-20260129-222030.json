The user is asking about the most appropriate next therapeutic option for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG who's progressed after initial treatment. \n\nFirst, I need to carefully review the context. The patient has a WHO grade IV diffuse midline glioma with H3 K27M mutation, plus ACVR1 mutation, PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, and germline TP53 variant. He completed radiation and tried ONC201 + panobinostat combo, but showed progression at 8 weeks. \n\nHmm... the key points I notice:\n- Re-irradiation is ruled out due to cumulative dose >60Gy\n- Tumor has PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6-fold)\n- There's a specific trial mentioned: NCT05234567 testing crenolanib for PDGFR\u03b1-amplified tumors\n\n*checks context again* Ah!

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative T2\u2011hyperintense lesion centered in the pons, consistent with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). A stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histology confirmed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling showed:\n\n- H3\u202fK27M mutation (H3F3A) confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n- Co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation.\n- PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6\u2011fold increase by FISH).\n- Germline TP53 R175H pathogenic variant (identified on a cancer predisposition panel).\n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions, completed 4\u202fweeks prior to presentation. At the end of radiation, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (600\u202fmg orally once weekly) and panobinostat (20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly). The trial reported a 6\u2011month overall survival (OS) of 55\u202f% for ONC201 monotherapy and a 12\u2011month OS of 30\u202f% for the combination regimen in H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients.\n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 nausea, managed with supportive care. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated radiographic progression with a 20\u202f% increase in tumor volume and new diffuse enhancement. Given progression despite maximal safe radiation and the ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat regimen, the treating team considered next\u2011line options. Re\u2011irradiation was deemed high\u2011risk due to cumulative brainstem dose exceeding 60\u202fGy. The patient\u2019s tumor harbors PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFR inhibition. A separate ongoing phase\u202fI/II trial (NCT05234567) is evaluating the selective PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitor crenolanib (100\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily) in pediatric high\u2011grade gliomas with PDGFR\u03b1 amplification.\n\nThe family inquires about the most appropriate next therapeutic approach, balancing potential efficacy, safety, and the child\u2019s molecular profile.",

Identify the therapies already tried: maximal safe radiation (54\u202fGy) and a combination trial of ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat, both of which have now failed as the tumor progressed.\n2. Evaluate the feasibility of re\u2011irradiation: cumulative brainstem dose would exceed 60\u202fGy, making it high\u2011risk and therefore not the preferred option.\n3. Examine the tumor\u2019s molecular alterations that could guide targeted therapy: the tumor harbors PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, which is a known actionable target for PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitors.\n4. Assess available trial data: a separate phase\u202fI/II trial (NCT05234567) is recruiting pediatric high\u2011grade glioma patients with PDGFR\u03b1 amplification for treatment with the selective PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitor crenolanib at 100\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily.\n5. Consider the patient\u2019s additional mutations (H3\u202fK27M, ACVR1, germline TP53) \u2013 these do not provide an alternative approved targeted agent, and the prior trial with ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat (which targets H3\u202fK27M pathways) was ineffective.\n6.

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative T2\u2011hyperintense lesion centered in the pons, consistent with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). A stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histology confirmed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling showed:\n\n- H3\u202fK27M mutation (H3F3A) confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n- Co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation.\n- PDGFR\u03b1 amplification (6\u2011fold increase by FISH).\n- Germline TP53 R175H pathogenic variant (identified on a cancer predisposition panel).\n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions, completed 4\u202fweeks prior to presentation. At the end of radiation, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (600\u202fmg orally once weekly) and panobinostat (20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly). The trial reported a 6\u2011month overall survival (OS) of 55\u202f% for ONC201 monotherapy and a 12\u2011month OS of 30\u202f% for the combination regimen in H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients.\n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 nausea, managed with supportive care. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated radiographic progression with a 20\u202f% increase in tumor volume and new diffuse enhancement.

Wait, but the instructions say \"provide your answer based ONLY on the proof.\" If the proof is empty, then the answer should reflect that there's no information.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" And step 3: \"provide your answer based ONLY on the proof.\"\n\nSo if the proof is empty (no quotes), then the answer must be that the context doesn't support the answer. But the problem states \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be something like \"The context does not provide information about the capital city of France.\"\n\nBut let me check again. The context is about DIPG, no mention of France's capital. So no quotes can be provided. Therefore, the proof section is empty, but according to the problem statement, empty proof leads to penalty, but the assistant must follow the rule. However, the user instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the assistant should not provide an answer. But the structure requires the answer tag. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So in this case, since there's no relevant quote, the assistant cannot answer the question. Therefore, the answer should state that the context does not contain the necessary information.\n\nBut how to structure it. The proof would have no quotes, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, the assistant must adhere to the rule. So perhaps the proof is empty, but the answer explains that.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer should indicate that. But the structure requires the answer tag. So maybe the answer is \"The context does not provide information about the capital city of France.\"\n\nBut according to the instructions, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be given. However, the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer should be that it's not possible to answer based on the context.\n\nYes, so the correct response is to have an empty proof (but the system says empty proof = penalty, but the assistant has to follow the rule), and the answer states that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the assistant must not provide an answer. But the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer is left empty? But the example shows [Final Answer] inside the answer tags.\n\nAlternatively, the answer should state that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the proof is empty (but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty, but the assistant has to follow the rule), but since there's no quote, the answer is that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but the assistant must follow the instruction. So even if it leads to a penalty, the assistant must not fabricate a quote. Therefore, the proof is empty, and the answer states that the context doesn't provide the necessary information.\n\nBut the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer should be that it's not possible to answer.
