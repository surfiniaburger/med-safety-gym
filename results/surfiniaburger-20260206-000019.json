He's also in a separate study using pembrolizumab, which is a PD-1 inhibitor. \n\nThe key points from the context: The ONC201 protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent use with any immune checkpoint inhibitor. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor, which falls under that category. So, the patient is violating the ONC201 trial's rules by being on both. \n\nAlso, the context mentions that patients with prior PD-1 inhibitor exposure had no survival benefit and more adverse events. But in this case, the patient is currently on pembrolizumab, not prior exposure. Wait, the quote says \"prior PD-1 inhibitor exposure,\" but the patient is currently enrolled in both trials, so maybe it's concurrent. The protocol says concurrent is prohibited. \n\nThe question is whether to continue pembrolizumab. Since the ONC201 protocol prohibits concurrent use, the patient shouldn't be on both. So, continuing pembrolizumab would violate the ONC201 trial's rules. Therefore, pembrolizumab should be stopped.\n\nRegarding ONC201 dosing: The platelet count is 110,000/\u00b5L, which is above the threshold of 100,000. The protocol says dose reduction is needed if platelets fall below 100k. Since it's 110k, no dose reduction is needed.

So the next step for ONC201 might be to stop it if they don't stop pembrolizumab, but the question is about the appropriate next step. The protocol prohibits concurrent use, so the correct action is to discontinue pembrolizumab to comply with the ONC201 trial.

The user is asking about a pediatric DIPG case in a clinical trial, specifically why the patient showed radiographic progression at week 8 and what protocol adjustment is allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully review the context. The patient is a 7-year-old with H3K27M-mutant DIPG enrolled in the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial. They received panobinostat + ONC201 with radiotherapy. Key points from the context:\n\n- Week 4 MRI showed stable disease\n- Week 8 MRI showed progression (15% volume increase with new enhancement)\n- Pharmacokinetics: panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, below the target \u22651.0 \u00b5M\n- Patient has ACVR1 mutation (p.R206H)\n- No significant toxicity (max grade 2 nausea)\n\nThe question asks for two things: explanation for progression and allowed protocol adjustment.\n\nLooking for direct evidence in the context... Ah! The outcome data section states: \"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" This directly links low panobinostat CSF levels (which this patient has at 0.48\u00b5M) and ACVR1 mutation to progression.\n\nFor the adjustment part, the protocol amendment section says two options: \n1) Panobinostat dose escalation to 30mg/m\u00b2 BID if CSF <1.0\u00b5M and \u2264grade 2 toxicity (which applies here)\n2) OR add everolimus for ACVR1 mutation + sub-therapeutic panobinostat\n\nBut the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\". The explanation is clearly the inadequate CNS penetration due to low CSF levels, specifically highlighted for ACVR1-mutant cases. For adjustment, both options are allowed, but the context emphasizes the ACVR1 connection, and the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation. However, the dose escalation is the primary option mentioned first in the amendment.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording: \"Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of everolimus...\" So dose escalation is the first option, everolimus is the alternative. But since the patient has ACVR1 mutation, both might apply. However, the question asks for \"the adjustment\" (singular) the protocol allows, and the context states dose escalation is permitted when CSF<1.0\u00b5M with low toxicity - which perfectly matches this case (0.48\u00b5M, grade 2 nausea). The everolimus option is specifically for \"documented ACVR1 mutation AND sub-therapeutic panobinostat\" - which also applies. \n\nBut the outcome data specifically blames inadequate penetration in ACVR1 cases, and the everolimus option is explicitly for that scenario. However, the protocol amendment lists dose escalation as the primary option when CSF<1.0\u00b5M. I think both are valid, but the question likely expects the dose escalation as the direct response to low CSF levels, with everolimus as an ACVR1-specific alternative. Since the patient meets criteria for dose escalation (CSF<1.0\u00b5M, \u2264grade 2 toxicity), that's the immediate allowed adjustment.\n\nConfirming proof quotes:\n- For explanation: \"inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations\"\n- For adjustment: \"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week 5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0 \u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade 2 toxicity\"\n\nYes, these are direct quotes that answer both parts.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity.

Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3. Therefore, the most likely explanation for progression is insufficient panobinostat exposure in the central nervous system, leading to inadequate histone deacetylase inhibition and allowing tumor growth.\n4. Review the protocol\u2019s permitted modifications: if CSF levels are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and toxicity is \u2264 grade\u202f2, panobinostat dose may be escalated to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5; alternatively, everolimus can be added for ACVR1\u2011mutant patients with sub\u2011therapeutic exposure.\n5.

The explanation is clearly the inadequate CNS penetration due to low CSF levels, specifically highlighted for ACVR1-mutant cases. For adjustment, both options are allowed, but the context emphasizes the ACVR1 connection, and the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation. However, the dose escalation is the primary option mentioned first in the amendment.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording: \"Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of everolimus...\" So dose escalation is the first option, everolimus is the alternative. But since the patient has ACVR1 mutation, both might apply. However, the question asks for \"the adjustment\" (singular) the protocol allows, and the context states dose escalation is permitted when CSF<1.0\u00b5M with low toxicity - which perfectly matches this case (0.48\u00b5M, grade 2 nausea). The everolimus option is specifically for \"documented ACVR1 mutation AND sub-therapeutic panobinostat\" - which also applies. \n\nBut the outcome data specifically blames inadequate penetration in ACVR1 cases, and the everolimus option is explicitly for that scenario. However, the protocol amendment lists dose escalation as the primary option when CSF<1.0\u00b5M. I think both are valid, but the question likely expects the dose escalation as the direct response to low CSF levels, with everolimus as an ACVR1-specific alternative. Since the patient meets criteria for dose escalation (CSF<1.0\u00b5M, \u2264grade 2 toxicity), that's the immediate allowed adjustment.\n\nConfirming proof quotes:\n- For explanation: \"inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations\"\n- For adjustment: \"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week 5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0 \u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade 2 toxicity\"\n\nYes, these are direct quotes that answer both parts.",

              "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the patient is a 7-year-old boy with DIPG who had radiation therapy and then started on a clinical trial with ONC201 and everolimus. After 8 weeks, the MRI shows a 30% reduction in the pontine lesion, which is a partial response. But there's new ventricular enlargement and symptoms of hydrocephalus\u2014headache, nausea, vomiting. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells.\n\nThe question is asking for the most appropriate next management step based solely on the provided context. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe context mentions that the trial protocol reports a 15% response rate and 4.2 months median PFS. The investigators recommend continuing the study drugs if there's a radiographic response, provided adverse events are managed appropriately.\n\nThe key here is that the patient has a partial response (so the treatment is working on the tumor), but now has hydrocephalus symptoms. The hydrocephalus is likely due to the ventricular enlargement, which could be from obstruction or other causes. Since CSF cytology is negative, it's not malignant cells causing it. So the hydrocephalus is probably a complication needing management.\n\nThe trial's recommendation says to continue the drugs if adverse events are managed. So the next step should be managing the hydrocephalus (like a VP shunt or ETV) while continuing the study drugs. The context doesn't mention stopping the trial drugs because of the response, but emphasizes managing adverse events.\n\nWait, the hydrocephalus is a new issue. The question is about the next management step. The answer should be to address the hydrocephalus, since that's the acute problem causing symptoms, while continuing the study drugs as per protocol.\n\nLooking at the context again: \"the investigators recommend continuing the study drugs in patients who achieve radiographic response, provided that adverse events are managed appropriately.\" So managing the adverse event (hydrocephalus) allows continuing the drugs. Therefore, the next step is to treat the hydrocephalus.\n\nPossible options could be VP shunt, ETV, or maybe steroids, but the context says dexamethasone was tapered after radiation. However, the immediate management for symptomatic hydrocephalus is usually surgical intervention. But the context doesn't specify options, just what's in the text.\n\nThe context states that lumbar puncture was done, CSF negative. So the hydrocephalus is likely obstructive. The next step would be to manage the hydrocephalus, which is an adverse event, so that they can continue the study drugs.\n\nSo the answer should be to manage the hydrocephalus (e.g., VP shunt) and continue the study drugs.

After 8 weeks, the MRI shows a 30% reduction in the pontine lesion, which is a partial response. But there's new ventricular enlargement and symptoms of hydrocephalus\u2014headache, nausea, vomiting. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells.\n\nThe question is asking for the most appropriate next management step based solely on the provided context. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe context mentions that the trial protocol reports a 15% response rate and 4.2 months median PFS. The investigators recommend continuing the study drugs if there's a radiographic response, provided adverse events are managed appropriately.\n\nThe key here is that the patient has a partial response (so the treatment is working on the tumor), but now has hydrocephalus symptoms. The hydrocephalus is likely due to the ventricular enlargement, which could be from obstruction or other causes. Since CSF cytology is negative, it's not malignant cells causing it. So the hydrocephalus is probably a complication needing management.\n\nThe trial's recommendation says to continue the drugs if adverse events are managed. So the next step should be managing the hydrocephalus (like a VP shunt or ETV) while continuing the study drugs. The context doesn't mention stopping the trial drugs because of the response, but emphasizes managing adverse events.\n\nWait, the hydrocephalus is a new issue. The question is about the next management step. The answer should be to address the hydrocephalus, since that's the acute problem causing symptoms, while continuing the study drugs as per protocol.\n\nLooking at the context again: \"the investigators recommend continuing the study drugs in patients who achieve radiographic response, provided that adverse events are managed appropriately.\" So managing the adverse event (hydrocephalus) allows continuing the drugs. Therefore, the next step is to treat the hydrocephalus.\n\nPossible options could be VP shunt, ETV, or maybe steroids, but the context says dexamethasone was tapered after radiation. However, the immediate management for symptomatic hydrocephalus is usually surgical intervention. But the context doesn't specify options, just what's in the text.\n\nThe context states that lumbar puncture was done, CSF negative. So the hydrocephalus is likely obstructive. The next step would be to manage the hydrocephalus, which is an adverse event, so that they can continue the study drugs.\n\nSo the answer should be to manage the hydrocephalus (e.g., VP shunt) and continue the study drugs.

The user is asking about a pediatric DIPG case in a clinical trial, specifically why the patient showed radiographic progression at week 8 and what protocol adjustment is allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully review the context. The patient is a 7-year-old with H3K27M-mutant DIPG enrolled in the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial. They received panobinostat + ONC201 with radiotherapy. Key points from the context:\n\n- Week 4 MRI showed stable disease\n- Week 8 MRI showed progression (15% volume increase with new enhancement)\n- Pharmacokinetics: panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, below the target \u22651.0 \u00b5M\n- Patient has ACVR1 mutation (p.R206H)\n- No significant toxicity (max grade 2 nausea)\n\nThe question asks for two things: explanation for progression and allowed protocol adjustment.\n\nLooking for direct evidence in the context... Ah! The outcome data section states: \"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" This directly links low panobinostat CSF levels (which this patient has at 0.48\u00b5M) and ACVR1 mutation to progression.\n\nFor the adjustment part, the protocol amendment section says two options: \n1) Panobinostat dose escalation to 30mg/m\u00b2 BID if CSF <1.0\u00b5M and \u2264grade 2 toxicity (which applies here)\n2) OR add everolimus for ACVR1 mutation + sub-therapeutic panobinostat\n\nBut the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\". The explanation is clearly the inadequate CNS penetration due to low CSF levels, specifically highlighted for ACVR1-mutant cases. For adjustment, both options are allowed, but the context emphasizes the ACVR1 connection, and the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation. However, the dose escalation is the primary option mentioned first in the amendment.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording: \"Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of everolimus...\" So dose escalation is the first option, everolimus is the alternative. But since the patient has ACVR1 mutation, both might apply. However, the question asks for \"the adjustment\" (singular) the protocol allows, and the context states dose escalation is permitted when CSF<1.0\u00b5M with low toxicity - which perfectly matches this case (0.48\u00b5M, grade 2 nausea). The everolimus option is specifically for \"documented ACVR1 mutation AND sub-therapeutic panobinostat\" - which also applies. \n\nBut the outcome data specifically blames inadequate penetration in ACVR1 cases, and the everolimus option is explicitly for that scenario. However, the protocol amendment lists dose escalation as the primary option when CSF<1.0\u00b5M. I think both are valid, but the question likely expects the dose escalation as the direct response to low CSF levels, with everolimus as an ACVR1-specific alternative. Since the patient meets criteria for dose escalation (CSF<1.0\u00b5M, \u2264grade 2 toxicity), that's the immediate allowed adjustment.\n\nConfirming proof quotes:\n- For explanation: \"inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations\"\n- For adjustment: \"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week 5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0 \u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade 2 toxicity\"\n\nYes, these are direct quotes that answer both parts.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity. Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5\u202fmg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub\u2011therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe radiographic progression at week 8 is most likely due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, specifically attributed to sub-therapeutic CSF concentration (0.48 \u00b5M, below the target \u22651.0 \u00b5M) in an ACVR1-mutant tumor.

Histologic confirmation was obtained via stereotactic biopsy, revealing a WHO grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma with the following molecular profile: H3K27M\u2011mutant (H3F3A p.K27M), ACVR1\u2011mutant (p.R206H), TP53 wild\u2011type, and MGMT promoter unmethylated.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the ongoing Phase\u202fII \u201cPAN\u2011ONC\u2011DIPG\u201d trial (NCT04567890), which investigates the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the imipridone ONC201 administered concurrently with standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions). Treatment protocol details:\n- Panobinostat: oral, 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily (BID) on days 1\u20115 of each radiotherapy week (total 5\u202fweeks).\n- ONC201: oral, 125\u202fmg once weekly on Fridays, beginning on week\u202f1 of radiotherapy.\n- Radiotherapy: 1.8\u202fGy per fraction, 5\u202fdays/week.\n\nPharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week\u202f4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48\u202f\u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M). No dose\u2011limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed; the highest recorded adverse event was grade\u202f2 nausea, managed with ondansetron.\n\nRadiographic assessments:\n- Baseline MRI (pre\u2011treatment): 3.2\u202fcm lesion, no contrast enhancement.\n- Week\u202f4 MRI (mid\u2011treatment): stable disease; lesion unchanged in size; no new enhancement.\n- Week\u202f8 MRI (post\u2011treatment, 2\u202fweeks after completion of radiotherapy): new T2\u2011hyperintense expansion measuring 3.7\u202fcm (\u224815\u202f% increase in volume) with mild contrast enhancement at the ventral margin, consistent with radiographic progression.\n\nTrial protocol amendment permits dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity. Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5\u202fmg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub\u2011therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\n\nOutcome data from the first 12 patients on the trial indicate a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 6.2\u202fmonths and an overall response rate (ORR) of 25\u202f% (partial responses). The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.",
                "question": "Based on the trial information and the patient\u2019s pharmacokinetic and imaging results, what is the most likely explanation for the radiographic progression observed at week\u202f8, and what adjustment to the therapeutic regimen does the protocol allow to address this issue?",
                "expected_answer": {
                  "final": "<think>\n1. Identify the key data points: the patient has H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations, received panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID, and CSF concentration at week\u202f4 was 0.48\u202f\u00b5M, which is below the target therapeutic level of \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M.\n2. Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3. Therefore, the most likely explanation for progression is insufficient panobinostat exposure in the central nervous system, leading to inadequate histone deacetylase inhibition and allowing tumor growth.\n4. Review the protocol\u2019s permitted modifications: if CSF levels are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and toxicity is \u2264 grade\u202f2, panobinostat dose may be escalated to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5; alternatively, everolimus can be added for ACVR1\u2011mutant patients with sub\u2011therapeutic exposure.\n5. Since the patient has only grade\u202f2 nausea (\u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity) and low CSF levels, the protocol allows dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID.\n6. Conclude: the progression is most likely due to sub\u2011therapeutic panobinostat CNS levels, and the appropriate protocol\u2011allowed adjustment is to increase the panobinostat dose to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week\u202f4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48\u202f\u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M).\"\n- \"Week\u202f8 MRI ... new T2\u2011hyperintense expansion measuring 3.7\u202fcm (\u224815\u202f% increase in volume), consistent with radiographic progression.\"\n- \"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- \"Trial protocol amendment permits dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity.\"\n- \"No dose\u2011limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed; the highest recorded adverse event was grade\u202f2 nausea.\"\n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nThe progression most likely reflects insufficient central\u2011nervous\u2011system exposure to panobinostat (CSF level 0.48\u202f\u00b5M, well below the \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M target), which allows the tumor to grow despite radiotherapy. Because the patient has only grade\u202f2 toxicity and sub\u2011therapeutic CSF concentrations, the protocol permits escalating panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5 to achieve adequate CNS levels.\n</answer>",

                "analysis": "Okay, let me tackle this medical question. The user is asking about a pediatric DIPG case in a clinical trial, specifically why the patient showed radiographic progression at week 8 and what protocol adjustment is allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully review the context. The patient is a 7-year-old with H3K27M-mutant DIPG enrolled in the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial. They received panobinostat + ONC201 with radiotherapy. Key points from the context:\n\n- Week 4 MRI showed stable disease\n- Week 8 MRI showed progression (15% volume increase with new enhancement)\n- Pharmacokinetics: panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, below the target \u22651.0 \u00b5M\n- Patient has ACVR1 mutation (p.R206H)\n- No significant toxicity (max grade 2 nausea)\n\nThe question asks for two things: explanation for progression and allowed protocol adjustment.\n\nLooking for direct evidence in the context... Ah! The outcome data section states: \"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" This directly links low panobinostat CSF levels (which this patient has at 0.48\u00b5M) and ACVR1 mutation to progression.\n\nFor the adjustment part, the protocol amendment section says two options: \n1) Panobinostat dose escalation to 30mg/m\u00b2 BID if CSF <1.0\u00b5M and \u2264grade 2 toxicity (which applies here)\n2) OR add everolimus for ACVR1 mutation + sub-therapeutic panobinostat\n\nBut the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\". The explanation is clearly the inadequate CNS penetration due to low CSF levels, specifically highlighted for ACVR1-mutant cases. For adjustment, both options are allowed, but the context emphasizes the ACVR1 connection, and the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation. However, the dose escalation is the primary option mentioned first in the amendment.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording: \"Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of everolimus...\" So dose escalation is the first option, everolimus is the alternative. But since the patient has ACVR1 mutation, both might apply. However, the question asks for \"the adjustment\" (singular) the protocol allows, and the context states dose escalation is permitted when CSF<1.0\u00b5M with low toxicity - which perfectly matches this case (0.48\u00b5M, grade 2 nausea). The everolimus option is specifically for \"documented ACVR1 mutation AND sub-therapeutic panobinostat\" - which also applies. \n\nBut the outcome data specifically blames inadequate penetration in ACVR1 cases, and the everolimus option is explicitly for that scenario. However, the protocol amendment lists dose escalation as the primary option when CSF<1.0\u00b5M. I think both are valid, but the question likely expects the dose escalation as the direct response to low CSF levels, with everolimus as an ACVR1-specific alternative. Since the patient meets criteria for dose escalation (CSF<1.0\u00b5M, \u2264grade 2 toxicity), that's the immediate allowed adjustment.\n\nConfirming proof quotes:\n- For explanation: \"inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations\"\n- For adjustment: \"dose escalation of panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week 5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0 \u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade 2 toxicity\"\n\nYes, these are direct quotes that answer both parts.",
