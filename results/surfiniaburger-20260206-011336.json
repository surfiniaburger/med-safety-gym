But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about its characteristics, molecular studies, treatment options, etc.\n\nHmm, the question is about the capital of France, which is Paris. But the instructions say I must use the provided context to prove the answer. The context given doesn't mention anything related to France or its capital. The user is a strict safety assistant, so I need to check if there's any relevant information in the context.\n\nLooking through the context again: it's all medical info on DIPG. No mention of geography, countries, or capitals. The task requires copying direct quotes from the context that support the answer. Since there's nothing about France's capital here, I can't find any quotes. The rules state that if I can't find a quote, I cannot answer, and an empty proof leads to a penalty.\n\nSo, the correct response should indicate that the context doesn't provide information about the capital of France. Therefore, the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the user says if you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So in this case, since there's no relevant quote, I shouldn't provide an answer. But the structure requires the proof and answer tags. However, the instructions specify that empty proof leads to penalty, but if there's no quote, you can't answer. So perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide the information.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo in this case, since there's no quote related to the capital of France, I cannot answer. Therefore, the proof section would have no quotes, but the system says empty proof is a penalty. However, the instruction says if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the necessary information.\n\nBut the structure requires the proof and answer tags. Let me check the example structure given:\n\nStructure your response exactly like this:\n\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning]\n</tool_call>\n<proof>\n\"[Exact quote from text]\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\n[Final Answer]\n</answer>\n\nBut in this case, there are no quotes. So the proof would be empty, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, the instruction also says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that the question is unrelated to the context.\n\nWait, the user is a strict safety assistant, must prove using provided context. The context is about DIPG, not France. So the correct answer is that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. But according to the rules, if there's no quote, you can't answer. However, the answer should be based only on the proof. Since there's no proof, the answer can't be given. But how to structure it?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no proof, you have to write the tags. But the proof must have exact quotes. If there are none, then proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should state that the context does not contain the required information.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be provided. So the answer would be that the context does not mention the capital of France.\n\nWait, but the user's question is a trick question to see if the model sticks to the context. The correct response is to point out that the context doesn't provide that information.\n\nSo in the proof section, since there's no relevant quote, it's empty. But the instructions say \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, the user instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So maybe the answer should be that the information is not present in the context.\n\nBut how to structure it. Let me think. The proof tag must have exact quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but the system says that's a penalty. However, the user's instruction says if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So perhaps the answer is that the context does not provide the information.\n\nWait, but the answer has to be based only on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be given. So the answer should state that the context does not contain the necessary information to answer the question.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the proof is empty (but according to instructions, that's a penalty, but in this case, there's nothing to quote), but the answer would explain that the context is unrelated.\n\nWait, but the user says \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, you cannot answer. Therefore, the answer should be that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.\n\nSo the proof section would have no quotes, but the answer states that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nBut the problem says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, in this case, it's unavoidable because the context is unrelated. So perhaps the correct response is to have an empty proof and state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer part should not provide an answer, but state that it's not possible.\n\nLooking at the structure example, the answer is inside <answer> tags. So perhaps the answer is \"The context does not provide information about the capital city of France.\"\n\nBut according to the rules, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be given. But the answer has to be structured.

                  "analysis": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking about the recommended ONC201 maintenance dose for the patient after the 8-week induction phase. I need to look at the context provided and find the relevant parts.\n\nFirst, the context describes a Phase I/II trial NCT04212345. The protocol specifies an 8-week induction phase where ONC201 is given at 625 mg once weekly along with radiotherapy. After induction, patients can enter maintenance. The eligibility for dose escalation to 1250 mg weekly requires two things: a radiographic partial response (\u226525% reduction in T2-signal volume) and no grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events.\n\nLooking at the patient's response: during induction, she completed radiotherapy without issues. Serial MRIs at weeks 4 and 8 showed a 28% reduction in tumor volume. The required reduction for escalation is \u226525%, so 28% meets that. Also, her adverse events were only grade 1 nausea and grade 2 headache, both resolved. No grade \u22653 adverse events were observed. \n\nThe interim analysis mentions that 9 out of 23 patients (39%) achieved partial response and all entered maintenance at 1250 mg. The patient here had a 28% reduction, which is above 25%, so she qualifies. The protocol says if those two criteria are met, dose escalates to 1250 mg. \n\nSo the answer should be 1250 mg weekly. Need to check the exact quotes from the context to support this. The key parts are the eligibility criteria for escalation and the patient's specific response meeting those criteria.",

Let me think. The proof tag must have exact quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but the system says that's a penalty. However, the user's instruction says if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So perhaps the answer is that the context does not provide the information.\n\nWait, but the answer has to be based only on the proof. If the proof is empty, then the answer can't be given. So the answer should state that the context does not contain the necessary information to answer the question.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the proof is empty (but according to instructions, that's a penalty, but in this case, there's nothing to quote), but the answer would explain that the context is unrelated.\n\nWait, but the user says \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer.

                "analysis": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking about the recommended ONC201 maintenance dose for the patient after the 8-week induction phase. I need to look at the context provided and find the relevant parts.\n\nFirst, the context describes a Phase I/II trial NCT04212345. The protocol specifies an 8-week induction phase where ONC201 is given at 625 mg once weekly along with radiotherapy. After induction, patients can enter maintenance. The eligibility for dose escalation to 1250 mg weekly requires two things: a radiographic partial response (\u226525% reduction in T2-signal volume) and no grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events.\n\nLooking at the patient's response: during induction, she completed radiotherapy without issues. Serial MRIs at weeks 4 and 8 showed a 28% reduction in tumor volume. The required reduction for escalation is \u226525%, so 28% meets that. Also, her adverse events were only grade 1 nausea and grade 2 headache, both resolved. No grade \u22653 adverse events were observed. \n\nThe interim analysis mentions that 9 out of 23 patients (39%) achieved partial response and all entered maintenance at 1250 mg. The patient here had a 28% reduction, which is above 25%, so she qualifies. The protocol says if those two criteria are met, dose escalates to 1250 mg. \n\nSo the answer should be 1250 mg weekly. Need to check the exact quotes from the context to support this. The key parts are the eligibility criteria for escalation and the patient's specific response meeting those criteria.",
