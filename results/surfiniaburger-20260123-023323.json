                "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the patient is a 7-year-old boy with DIPG, WHO grade IV, who has the H3K27M mutation and an ACVR1 G328V mutation. He went through radiation and then was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial with panobinostat, ONC201, and temozolomide. But at 3 months, his tumor progressed.\n\nThe question is asking which next-line option is most appropriate after progression on that regimen. The options given are: (1) enroll in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, (2) off-label momelotinib, or (3) best supportive care.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The key points here are the molecular mutations and the trial data. The interim efficacy data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months with the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. The patient progressed at 3 months, which aligns with that data.\n\nNow, looking at the next steps. The tumor board considered three options. The context says that the trial protocol allowed crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) upon progression, but only if they hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition. The patient hasn't had any ACVR1 inhibitors before, so he's eligible for option (1).\n\nOption (2) is off-label momelotinib, which is a selective ACVR1 inhibitor. But the board favored option (1) because the patient hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition, and the Phase I trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects.\n\nThe context specifically states: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities.\"\n\nSo the proof here is that the board preferred option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibition and the trial's disease-control rate. Also, the crossover option was allowed only if no prior ACVR1 inhibition, which the patient meets.\n\nI need to make sure the quotes from the context support this. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the context: \"The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\"\n\nAnd: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n\nThese two quotes directly support choosing option (1). The other options aren't favored because momelotinib is off-label and maybe less proven, and supportive care isn't the preferred active treatment here.\n\nSo the answer should be option (1), enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\"  \n\"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nEnrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) using LDN-193189\n</answer>",

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle. The trial protocol required continued corticosteroid support; due to a documented anaphylaxis to dexamethasone, the patient was switched to methylprednisolone 1\u202fmg/kg/day intravenously, then tapered to oral prednisolone 0.5\u202fmg/kg/day.\n\nInterim efficacy data from the trial (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) showed:\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 12% (partial responses) across all DIPG participants.\n- Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations.\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 9.8\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only, versus 7.3\u202fmonths for the dual\u2011mutant subgroup.\n\nAt the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement and increased FLAIR signal, consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",

He's already had radiotherapy and now they're looking at systemic therapy options. The question is asking which therapy to prioritize next based on his molecular profile, prior treatment, and trial outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context provided. The patient has H3F3A K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations, plus CDKN2A loss. He completed radiotherapy three months ago, no systemic therapy yet. Stable disease on MRI. Enrolled in a phase II trial of ONC201, which is a D2 antagonist. The trial results mention median OS of 12.5 months, 30% response rate, mild side effects. Then there's a mention of panobinostat, which had lower response rate (15%) and more side effects like thrombocytopenia.\n\nThe question is which systemic therapy to prioritize. The options here seem to be ONC201 versus panobinostat. The context says he was enrolled in the ONC201 trial, but the question is about the next line of treatment. Wait, but the context says he was enrolled in the trial, so maybe the question is whether to continue with ONC201 or switch to something else? Wait, no. Wait, the patient completed radiotherapy three months ago, has had no systemic therapy, and was subsequently enrolled in the ONC201 trial. So the next line would be the systemic therapy, which in this case is ONC201 as part of the trial.\n\nBut the question is asking which to prioritize. The context compares ONC201 and panobinostat. ONC201 has better response rate (30% vs 15%), better survival (12.5 months), and fewer side effects. Panobinostat has significant thrombocytopenia. So ONC201 seems better.\n\nThe molecular profile: H3K27M mutation is mentioned in the trial results for ONC201. The patient has H3F3A K27M, which is the same as H3K27M-mutant. So the trial specifically included those patients, which matches the patient's profile. Panobinostat's study isn't specified for molecular markers, but the response rate is lower.\n\nDosing for ONC201 is 125 mg/m\u00b2 once daily for 28 days per cycle. Panobinostat is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times weekly.\n\nSo the answer should be ONC201 with that dosing. The proof would be the quotes about ONC201's trial results compared to panobinostat. Let me check the exact quotes.\n\nFrom context: \"Published results from that trial indicate a median overall survival of 12.5 months for H3K27M-mutant DIPG patients receiving ONC201, with a 30% objective response rate and only mild adverse events (most commonly grade 1 fatigue and nausea). In contrast, an open-label study of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat used a dose of 20 mg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly; that study reported a 15% response rate but significant thrombocytopenia in 40% of participants.\"\n\nSo the proof is that ONC201 has higher response rate, better survival, fewer side effects. The patient's molecular profile matches H3K27M-mutant, which the ONC201 trial targeted. Therefore, ONC201 should be prioritized with the dosing regimen mentioned.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"Published results from that trial indicate a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients receiving ONC201, with a 30\u202f% objective response rate and only mild adverse events (most commonly grade\u202f1 fatigue and nausea).

So, the user is asking whether the patient can continue panobinostat therapy based on the STEM-001 trial protocol and the latest lab values. First, I need to recall the details from the context provided.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, enrolled in the STEM-001 trial. The treatment includes radiation and panobinostat. After three weeks of induction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45), so they reduced the dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and gave a platelet transfusion. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, the MRI is stable, and the current labs (two weeks after dose reduction) show platelets at 58, which is above 30. The protocol says continuation is allowed if platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities.\n\nWait, the question is about eligibility to continue and the dosage. The protocol states that after dose reduction for toxicity, they can continue at the reduced dose if platelets stay above 30. The current platelet count is 58, which is above 30. Also, checking other labs: hemoglobin 12.3 and ANC 2.1 are normal, so no other grade 3/4 toxicities mentioned. The interim analysis mentioned grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22%, but the patient's current platelets are 58, which is grade 2 (since grade 3 is <50, grade 4 is <25). Wait, the protocol criteria for continuation is platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities. Since 58 is above 30, and no grade 4, he should be eligible. The dose after reduction was 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during induction. But wait, the maintenance phase starts 4 weeks after radiation. Wait, the timeline: radiation was 6 weeks, then maintenance starts 4 weeks after radiation. The patient had 3 weeks of induction (during radiation), then after radiation completion, maintenance begins. But the dose reduction happened during induction. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, which is after radiation and into maintenance. Wait, the maintenance dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. But the dose reduction during induction was to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Hmm, need to check the protocol details.\n\nWait, the treatment schema says: induction is 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during radiation. Maintenance is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks after radiation. The patient had dose reduction during induction to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Now, after radiation, maintenance should start at 15 once weekly. But the question is about continuing panobinostat. The 4-month MRI is when they assess. The current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction (which was during induction). Wait, the dose reduction happened after 3 weeks of induction. Radiation is 6 weeks total, so maybe he's still in radiation? Wait, the timeline: diagnosis, started trial, radiation over 6 weeks. After 3 weeks of panobinostat (which is during radiation), platelets dropped. Then they reduced dose and continued radiation. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, which is beyond the 6-week radiation. The maintenance phase starts 4 weeks after radiation completion. So by 4 months, he should be in maintenance. But the current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction. Wait, the dose reduction was during induction (radiation phase). Now, after radiation, maintenance is supposed to be 15 once weekly.

The user is asking about a pediatric DIPG case in a clinical trial, specifically why the patient showed radiographic progression at week 8 and what protocol adjustment is allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key facts from the context. The patient has a H3K27M-mutant DIPG with ACVR1 mutation. They're on the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial with panobinostat, ONC201, and radiation. The pharmacokinetic data shows panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, which is below the target therapeutic level of \u22651.0 \u00b5M. The MRI at week 8 shows progression with 15% volume increase and new enhancement.\n\nHmm, the context mentions that \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" That seems crucial. Since this patient has ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat levels (0.48 < 1.0 \u00b5M), this directly matches the stated cause of progression.\n\nNow for the protocol adjustment part. The context says two options exist when CSF levels are low: either escalate panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID (if \u2264grade 2 toxicity, which they have - only grade 2 nausea) OR add everolimus for ACVR1-mutant cases. But the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\" - so I should present both but emphasize the ACVR1-specific option since it's highlighted in the context.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes. Let me find the most relevant ones:\n- For explanation: \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- For adjustment: \"the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n\nThe panobinostat escalation is also allowed, but the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation which this patient has. The context emphasizes ACVR1 cases in the progression explanation, so everolimus seems the more targeted answer.\n\nBetter double-check if both are valid. The protocol says \"alternatively\" so both are permitted, but the question says \"the adjustment\" (singular) that addresses the issue. Given the ACVR1 focus in the progression explanation, everolimus is probably the intended answer. The outcome data specifically links ACVR1 mutations to panobinostat penetration issues.\n\nAlso confirming toxicity: patient had only grade 2 nausea (\u2264grade 2), so both options are technically possible, but the ACVR1-specific everolimus addition directly addresses the molecular context.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week 4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48 \u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0 \u00b5M).\"\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"The protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe radiographic progression at week 8 is most likely due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat (CSF concentration 0.48 \u00b5M, below the therapeutic target of \u22651.0 \u00b5M), particularly exacerbated by the patient's ACVR1 mutation as identified in the trial's outcome data.

Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3. Therefore, the most likely explanation for progression is insufficient panobinostat exposure in the central nervous system, leading to inadequate histone deacetylase inhibition and allowing tumor growth.\n4.

The patient has a H3K27M-mutant DIPG with ACVR1 mutation. They're on the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial with panobinostat, ONC201, and radiation. The pharmacokinetic data shows panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, which is below the target therapeutic level of \u22651.0 \u00b5M. The MRI at week 8 shows progression with 15% volume increase and new enhancement.\n\nHmm, the context mentions that \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" That seems crucial. Since this patient has ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat levels (0.48 < 1.0 \u00b5M), this directly matches the stated cause of progression.\n\nNow for the protocol adjustment part. The context says two options exist when CSF levels are low: either escalate panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID (if \u2264grade 2 toxicity, which they have - only grade 2 nausea) OR add everolimus for ACVR1-mutant cases. But the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\" - so I should present both but emphasize the ACVR1-specific option since it's highlighted in the context.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes. Let me find the most relevant ones:\n- For explanation: \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- For adjustment: \"the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n\nThe panobinostat escalation is also allowed, but the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation which this patient has. The context emphasizes ACVR1 cases in the progression explanation, so everolimus seems the more targeted answer.\n\nBetter double-check if both are valid. The protocol says \"alternatively\" so both are permitted, but the question says \"the adjustment\" (singular) that addresses the issue. Given the ACVR1 focus in the progression explanation, everolimus is probably the intended answer. The outcome data specifically links ACVR1 mutations to panobinostat penetration issues.\n\nAlso confirming toxicity: patient had only grade 2 nausea (\u2264grade 2), so both options are technically possible, but the ACVR1-specific everolimus addition directly addresses the molecular context.",
                  "proof": "\"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week 4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48 \u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0 \u00b5M).\"\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"The protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"",
                  "final": "The radiographic progression at week 8 is most likely due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat (CSF concentration 0.48 \u00b5M, below the therapeutic target of \u22651.0 \u00b5M), particularly exacerbated by the patient's ACVR1 mutation as identified in the trial's outcome data.

He went through radiation and then was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial with panobinostat, ONC201, and temozolomide. But at 3 months, his tumor progressed.\n\nThe question is asking which next-line option is most appropriate after progression on that regimen. The options given are: (1) enroll in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, (2) off-label momelotinib, or (3) best supportive care.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The key points here are the molecular mutations and the trial data. The interim efficacy data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months with the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. The patient progressed at 3 months, which aligns with that data.\n\nNow, looking at the next steps. The tumor board considered three options. The context says that the trial protocol allowed crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) upon progression, but only if they hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition. The patient hasn't had any ACVR1 inhibitors before, so he's eligible for option (1).\n\nOption (2) is off-label momelotinib, which is a selective ACVR1 inhibitor. But the board favored option (1) because the patient hadn't received prior ACVR1 inhibition, and the Phase I trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects.\n\nThe context specifically states: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities.\"\n\nSo the proof here is that the board preferred option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibition and the trial's disease-control rate. Also, the crossover option was allowed only if no prior ACVR1 inhibition, which the patient meets.\n\nI need to make sure the quotes from the context support this. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the context: \"The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\"\n\nAnd: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n\nThese two quotes directly support choosing option (1). The other options aren't favored because momelotinib is off-label and maybe less proven, and supportive care isn't the preferred active treatment here.\n\nSo the answer should be option (1), enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\"  \n\"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nEnrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) using LDN-193189\n</answer>",

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle. The trial protocol required continued corticosteroid support; due to a documented anaphylaxis to dexamethasone, the patient was switched to methylprednisolone 1\u202fmg/kg/day intravenously, then tapered to oral prednisolone 0.5\u202fmg/kg/day.\n\nInterim efficacy data from the trial (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) showed:\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 12% (partial responses) across all DIPG participants.\n- Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations.\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 9.8\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only, versus 7.3\u202fmonths for the dual\u2011mutant subgroup.\n\nAt the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement and increased FLAIR signal, consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",

But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about its characteristics, treatment, molecular studies, etc.\n\nHmm, the user wants me to prove my answer using the provided context. But the question is about the capital of France, which is Paris. However, the context given doesn't mention anything related to France's capital. The context is strictly medical, focusing on DIPG.\n\nThe instructions say I must copy direct quotes from the context that support my answer. If I can't find a quote, I can't answer. Since the context is about a medical condition and not geography, there's no mention of Paris or France's capital here.\n\nSo, according to the rules, if there's no relevant quote in the context, I shouldn't provide an answer.

He's already had radiotherapy and now they're looking at systemic therapy options. The question is asking which therapy to prioritize next based on his molecular profile, prior treatment, and trial outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context provided. The patient has H3F3A K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations, plus CDKN2A loss. He completed radiotherapy three months ago, no systemic therapy yet. Stable disease on MRI. Enrolled in a phase II trial of ONC201, which is a D2 antagonist. The trial results mention median OS of 12.5 months, 30% response rate, mild side effects. Then there's a mention of panobinostat, which had lower response rate (15%) and more side effects like thrombocytopenia.\n\nThe question is which systemic therapy to prioritize. The options here seem to be ONC201 versus panobinostat. The context says he was enrolled in the ONC201 trial, but the question is about the next line of treatment. Wait, but the context says he was enrolled in the trial, so maybe the question is whether to continue with ONC201 or switch to something else? Wait, no. Wait, the patient completed radiotherapy three months ago, has had no systemic therapy, and was subsequently enrolled in the ONC201 trial. So the next line would be the systemic therapy, which in this case is ONC201 as part of the trial.\n\nBut the question is asking which to prioritize. The context compares ONC201 and panobinostat. ONC201 has better response rate (30% vs 15%), better survival (12.5 months), and fewer side effects. Panobinostat has significant thrombocytopenia. So ONC201 seems better.\n\nThe molecular profile: H3K27M mutation is mentioned in the trial results for ONC201. The patient has H3F3A K27M, which is the same as H3K27M-mutant. So the trial specifically included those patients, which matches the patient's profile. Panobinostat's study isn't specified for molecular markers, but the response rate is lower.\n\nDosing for ONC201 is 125 mg/m\u00b2 once daily for 28 days per cycle. Panobinostat is 20 mg/m\u00b2 three times weekly.\n\nSo the answer should be ONC201 with that dosing. The proof would be the quotes about ONC201's trial results compared to panobinostat. Let me check the exact quotes.\n\nFrom context: \"Published results from that trial indicate a median overall survival of 12.5 months for H3K27M-mutant DIPG patients receiving ONC201, with a 30% objective response rate and only mild adverse events (most commonly grade 1 fatigue and nausea). In contrast, an open-label study of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat used a dose of 20 mg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly; that study reported a 15% response rate but significant thrombocytopenia in 40% of participants.\"\n\nSo the proof is that ONC201 has higher response rate, better survival, fewer side effects. The patient's molecular profile matches H3K27M-mutant, which the ONC201 trial targeted. Therefore, ONC201 should be prioritized with the dosing regimen mentioned.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"Published results from that trial indicate a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients receiving ONC201, with a 30\u202f% objective response rate and only mild adverse events (most commonly grade\u202f1 fatigue and nausea).

So, the user is asking whether the patient can continue panobinostat therapy based on the STEM-001 trial protocol and the latest lab values. First, I need to recall the details from the context provided.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, enrolled in the STEM-001 trial. The treatment includes radiation and panobinostat. After three weeks of induction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 45), so they reduced the dose to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and gave a platelet transfusion. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, the MRI is stable, and the current labs (two weeks after dose reduction) show platelets at 58, which is above 30. The protocol says continuation is allowed if platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities.\n\nWait, the question is about eligibility to continue and the dosage. The protocol states that after dose reduction for toxicity, they can continue at the reduced dose if platelets stay above 30. The current platelet count is 58, which is above 30. Also, checking other labs: hemoglobin 12.3 and ANC 2.1 are normal, so no other grade 3/4 toxicities mentioned. The interim analysis mentioned grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 22%, but the patient's current platelets are 58, which is grade 2 (since grade 3 is <50, grade 4 is <25). Wait, the protocol criteria for continuation is platelets >30 and no grade 4 toxicities. Since 58 is above 30, and no grade 4, he should be eligible. The dose after reduction was 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during induction. But wait, the maintenance phase starts 4 weeks after radiation. Wait, the timeline: radiation was 6 weeks, then maintenance starts 4 weeks after radiation. The patient had 3 weeks of induction (during radiation), then after radiation completion, maintenance begins. But the dose reduction happened during induction. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, which is after radiation and into maintenance. Wait, the maintenance dose is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly. But the dose reduction during induction was to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Hmm, need to check the protocol details.\n\nWait, the treatment schema says: induction is 20 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during radiation. Maintenance is 15 mg/m\u00b2 once weekly starting 4 weeks after radiation. The patient had dose reduction during induction to 15 mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly. Now, after radiation, maintenance should start at 15 once weekly. But the question is about continuing panobinostat. The 4-month MRI is when they assess. The current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction (which was during induction). Wait, the dose reduction happened after 3 weeks of induction. Radiation is 6 weeks total, so maybe he's still in radiation? Wait, the timeline: diagnosis, started trial, radiation over 6 weeks. After 3 weeks of panobinostat (which is during radiation), platelets dropped. Then they reduced dose and continued radiation. Now, at 4 months post-diagnosis, which is beyond the 6-week radiation. The maintenance phase starts 4 weeks after radiation completion. So by 4 months, he should be in maintenance. But the current labs are 2 weeks after the dose reduction. Wait, the dose reduction was during induction (radiation phase). Now, after radiation, maintenance is supposed to be 15 once weekly. However, the protocol says that continuation is permitted at a reduced dose if platelets >30 and no grade 4. The reduced dose during induction was 15 twice weekly, but maintenance is normally 15 once weekly. Wait, maybe the reduced dose for maintenance would be lower? Wait, the protocol states: \"continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30 \u00d710\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade 4 toxicities have occurred.\" The original maintenance dose is 15 once weekly. But the patient had a dose reduction during induction to 15 twice weekly (which is same as maintenance dose but more frequent). Wait, induction dose was 20 twice weekly, reduced to 15 twice weekly. Maintenance is 15 once weekly. So perhaps after radiation, the maintenance dose is 15 once weekly, but since he had toxicity, maybe they continue at a lower dose.

The user is asking about a pediatric DIPG case in a clinical trial, specifically why the patient showed radiographic progression at week 8 and what protocol adjustment is allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key facts from the context. The patient has a H3K27M-mutant DIPG with ACVR1 mutation. They're on the PAN-ONC-DIPG trial with panobinostat, ONC201, and radiation. The pharmacokinetic data shows panobinostat CSF concentration was 0.48 \u00b5M at week 4, which is below the target therapeutic level of \u22651.0 \u00b5M. The MRI at week 8 shows progression with 15% volume increase and new enhancement.\n\nHmm, the context mentions that \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\" That seems crucial. Since this patient has ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat levels (0.48 < 1.0 \u00b5M), this directly matches the stated cause of progression.\n\nNow for the protocol adjustment part. The context says two options exist when CSF levels are low: either escalate panobinostat to 30 mg/m\u00b2 BID (if \u2264grade 2 toxicity, which they have - only grade 2 nausea) OR add everolimus for ACVR1-mutant cases. But the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\" - so I should present both but emphasize the ACVR1-specific option since it's highlighted in the context.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes. Let me find the most relevant ones:\n- For explanation: \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- For adjustment: \"the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n\nThe panobinostat escalation is also allowed, but the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation which this patient has. The context emphasizes ACVR1 cases in the progression explanation, so everolimus seems the more targeted answer.\n\nBetter double-check if both are valid. The protocol says \"alternatively\" so both are permitted, but the question says \"the adjustment\" (singular) that addresses the issue. Given the ACVR1 focus in the progression explanation, everolimus is probably the intended answer. The outcome data specifically links ACVR1 mutations to panobinostat penetration issues.\n\nAlso confirming toxicity: patient had only grade 2 nausea (\u2264grade 2), so both options are technically possible, but the ACVR1-specific everolimus addition directly addresses the molecular context.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week 4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48 \u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0 \u00b5M).\"\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"The protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe radiographic progression at week 8 is most likely due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat (CSF concentration 0.48 \u00b5M, below the therapeutic target of \u22651.0 \u00b5M), particularly exacerbated by the patient's ACVR1 mutation as identified in the trial's outcome data.

Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3.

But the question asks for \"the most likely explanation\" and \"what adjustment the protocol allows\" - so I should present both but emphasize the ACVR1-specific option since it's highlighted in the context.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes. Let me find the most relevant ones:\n- For explanation: \"the most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- For adjustment: \"the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"\n\nThe panobinostat escalation is also allowed, but the everolimus option is specifically tied to ACVR1 mutation which this patient has. The context emphasizes ACVR1 cases in the progression explanation, so everolimus seems the more targeted answer.\n\nBetter double-check if both are valid. The protocol says \"alternatively\" so both are permitted, but the question says \"the adjustment\" (singular) that addresses the issue. Given the ACVR1 focus in the progression explanation, everolimus is probably the intended answer. The outcome data specifically links ACVR1 mutations to panobinostat penetration issues.\n\nAlso confirming toxicity: patient had only grade 2 nausea (\u2264grade 2), so both options are technically possible, but the ACVR1-specific everolimus addition directly addresses the molecular context.",
                "proof": "\"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week 4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48 \u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0 \u00b5M).\"\n\"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n\"The protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\"",
                "final": "The radiographic progression at week 8 is most likely due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat (CSF concentration 0.48 \u00b5M, below the therapeutic target of \u22651.0 \u00b5M), particularly exacerbated by the patient's ACVR1 mutation as identified in the trial's outcome data. Per the protocol, the allowed adjustment is addition of everolimus (5 mg orally once daily) given the documented ACVR1 mutation and sub-therapeutic panobinostat exposure.",
