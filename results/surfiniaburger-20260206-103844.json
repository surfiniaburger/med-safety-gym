Let me check again.\n\nThe context says: \"The oncology team discussed possible treatment options, mentioning both conventional radiotherapy and a clinical trial of a novel epigenetic inhibitor, but no decision has been recorded.\" There's no mention of the specific dose. So there's no quote in the context that states the radiation dose. \n\nTherefore, according to the rules, if I can't find a direct quote, I shouldn't answer. The proof would be empty, which incurs a penalty. But the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" so I must not provide an answer if there's no quote. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something.

The child has a progressive gait disturbance and facial weakness. The MRI shows a T2-hyperintense, non-enhancing lesion in the pons, which the neuroradiology report says is consistent with DIPG.

Without knowing if the mutation is present, the patient can't be confirmed as eligible. Even though DIPG often has this mutation, the pathology report here doesn't confirm it.
