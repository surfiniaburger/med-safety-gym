It is characterized by its infiltrative growth pattern and resistance to surgical resection. Molecular studies have shown frequent mutations in the H3K27M histone gene, which drive oncogenesis. Standard treatment options are limited to focal radiation therapy, which provides temporary symptomatic relief. Recent clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy approaches. Prognosis remains poor, with median overall survival of less than one year from diagnosis.",
