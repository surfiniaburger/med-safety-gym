The MRI shows a diffusely infiltrating lesion in the pons extending into the middle cerebellar peduncles. The neurosurgery team says it's \"highly eloquent\" and advises against surgery.

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, hyperintense on T2\u2011weighted images and demonstrating faint contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with the following molecular profile: H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3 variant), ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and MGMT promoter unmethylated. \n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with temozolomide (75\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily) for 6\u202fweeks. After completing radiotherapy, the patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of the imipridone ONC201 (625\u202fmg orally once weekly) plus the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally daily). He tolerated the regimen without grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicities. At the 8\u2011week post\u2011radiation MRI, the lesion showed a 15% reduction in volume, and neurological symptoms improved.\n\nAt 3\u202fmonths after trial enrollment, repeat MRI demonstrated new nodular enhancement and an increase in lesion volume by 35%, consistent with radiographic progression. The trial\u2019s interim data reported a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.5\u202fmonths and a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants with H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant DIPG treated with ONC201\u202f+\u202feverolimus. No significant benefit was observed in the subset harboring ACVR1 mutations. \n\nGiven the progression, the treating team considered next\u2011line options.

The MRI shows a diffusely infiltrating lesion in the pons extending into the middle cerebellar peduncles. The neurosurgery team says it's \"highly eloquent\" and advises against surgery. The biopsy pathology report says \"high-grade glioma with necrosis\" but no molecular testing.

Then a second radiology report a week later suggests a possible cystic component, indicating a low-grade tumor, which contradicts the pathology.\n\nThe question is about the radiotherapy dose. The context mentions that oncology says \"standard therapy\" but no specifics. The problem is that the diagnosis is conflicting: pathology says high-grade glioma, but the second radiology report suggests low-grade. High-grade gliomas in the brain, especially in children, might have different treatment protocols. However, the context doesn't provide any specific dose information. The oncology note says they'll proceed with standard therapy but doesn't state what that is.

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, hyperintense on T2\u2011weighted images and demonstrating faint contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with the following molecular profile: H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3 variant), ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, wild\u2011type TP53, and MGMT promoter unmethylated. \n\nInitial management consisted of focal conformal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with temozolomide (75\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily) for 6\u202fweeks. After completing radiotherapy, the patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of the imipridone ONC201 (625\u202fmg orally once weekly) plus the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally daily). He tolerated the regimen without grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicities. At the 8\u2011week post\u2011radiation MRI, the lesion showed a 15% reduction in volume, and neurological symptoms improved.\n\nAt 3\u202fmonths after trial enrollment, repeat MRI demonstrated new nodular enhancement and an increase in lesion volume by 35%, consistent with radiographic progression. The trial\u2019s interim data reported a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.5\u202fmonths and a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants with H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant DIPG treated with ONC201\u202f+\u202feverolimus. No significant benefit was observed in the subset harboring ACVR1 mutations. \n\nGiven the progression, the treating team considered next\u2011line options. Re\u2011irradiation (10\u202fGy in 5 fractions) is an accepted salvage approach but carries a risk of cumulative neurotoxicity. An ongoing Phase\u202fI trial (NCT05233421) is evaluating the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN\u2011193189 at a dose of 100\u202fmg orally once daily in pediatric patients with ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG who have progressed after standard radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Additionally, a separate Phase\u202fI/II study (NCT04911234) is testing an H3\u2011K27M peptide vaccine administered intradermally every 3\u202fweeks, showing preliminary immunogenicity but limited efficacy data in patients previously treated with ONC201.\n\nThe family prefers a therapeutic option that directly targets the identified ACVR1 mutation while minimizing additional radiation exposure.",
