The context talks about medical details like histone mutations, MRI imaging, and treatment options. There's nothing here about the FIFA World Cup or any sports events.\n\nAs a strict safety assistant, I need to check if the context contains the answer. The instructions say I must use direct quotes from the context to support my answer. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. Let me scan the context again. The first sentence is about DIPG affecting children, then survival rates, H3K27M mutations, MRI findings, and standard care with radiation. No mention of sports, FIFA, or 1994.\n\nSince the question is outside the scope of the provided context, I can't find any quotes related to the World Cup. The rules state that if there's no quote, I shouldn't answer. So the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof leads to a penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the correct response is to state that the context doesn't provide information on that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer should be that the context doesn't contain the information. But how to structure it. The proof must have exact quotes, but there are none. So the proof would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof = penalty. Hmm, but the user's instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer is that the information isn't in the context.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, I can't answer. But the answer tag still needs to be there. Wait, the structure requires proof and answer. But if there's no quote, then the proof is empty, which is a penalty, but according to the instructions, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no info, I have to follow the structure. But the proof must have exact quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the user's instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer is that the answer cannot be determined from the context.\n\nWait, looking at the example structure given: the proof must have exact quotes. If none, then proof is empty, but the user says empty proof = penalty. However, the instruction also says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So maybe the correct approach is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"You MUST copy direct quotes... If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So \"cannot answer\" meaning you shouldn't provide an answer. But the structure requires an answer tag. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So if there's no quote, you can't answer, which would mean the answer tag should indicate that. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide information about the 1994 FIFA World Cup winner. But the proof would have no quotes, but the instructions say empty proof is a penalty. However, the user's instruction says if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer is that the information is not present in the context.\n\nIn this case, the proof section would have no quotes, but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty.

The context talks about medical details like histone mutations, MRI imaging, and treatment options. There's nothing here about the FIFA World Cup or any sports events.\n\nAs a strict safety assistant, I need to check if the context contains the answer. The instructions say I must use direct quotes from the context to support my answer. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. Let me scan the context again. The first sentence is about DIPG affecting children, then survival rates, H3K27M mutations, MRI findings, and standard care with radiation. No mention of sports, FIFA, or 1994.\n\nSince the question is outside the scope of the provided context, I can't find any quotes related to the World Cup. The rules state that if there's no quote, I shouldn't answer. So the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof leads to a penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the correct response is to state that the context doesn't provide information on that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So the answer should be that the context doesn't contain the information. But how to structure it. The proof must have exact quotes, but there are none. So the proof would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof = penalty. Hmm, but the user's instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer is that the information isn't in the context.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, I can't answer. But the answer tag still needs to be there. Wait, the structure requires proof and answer. But if there's no quote, then the proof is empty, which is a penalty, but according to the instructions, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Your final response MUST be structured using XML-like tags.\" So even if there's no info, I have to follow the structure. But the proof must have exact quotes. Since there are none, the proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the user's instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer is that the answer cannot be determined from the context.\n\nWait, looking at the example structure given: the proof must have exact quotes. If none, then proof is empty, but the user says empty proof = penalty. However, the instruction also says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So maybe the correct approach is to have an empty proof and then in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"You MUST copy direct quotes... If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So \"cannot answer\" meaning you shouldn't provide an answer. But the structure requires an answer tag. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So if there's no quote, you can't answer, which would mean the answer tag should indicate that. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide information about the 1994 FIFA World Cup winner. But the proof would have no quotes, but the instructions say empty proof is a penalty. However, the user's instruction says if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer.

After two cycles, there was a 25% reduction in tumor volume - that's a partial response by RANO criteria.

The context mentions a Phase II study (NCT03987456) showing median OS of 15 months, but crucially it \"excluded patients with prior exposure to ONC201 or panobinostat\". Since our patient is currently responding to ONC201+panobinostat, he wouldn't qualify for paxalisib anyway.\n\nThe key evidence points are:\n1) The current regimen is working (25% volume reduction)\n2) It's well-tolerated (only mild AEs)\n3) The alternative option explicitly excludes patients like him\n\nI should check if there's any reason to switch despite the response. The context doesn't mention disease progression on the current regimen - in fact it's improving.

So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG after his tumor progressed on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context provided is pretty detailed, so I need to go through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the patient has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial, which combined panobinostat, ONC201, and low-dose temozolomide. After 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nLooking at the context, the interim data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. That's really short, which explains why he progressed quickly. The trial protocol mentions that upon progression, crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) is allowed only if the patient hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. Since he was on panobinostat and ONC201, which aren't ACVR1 inhibitors, he hasn't received any ACVR1-targeted therapy yet. \n\nThe tumor board favored option (1), the Phase I trial with LDN-193189, because he hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. The context states that the trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects. Momelotinib is an option but it's off-label, and the board preferred the clinical trial. Also, best supportive care is less aggressive, but given the disease-control rate, the trial seems more beneficial.\n\nI need to check if there's a direct quote supporting this. The context says: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\" That's a clear statement. Also, the crossover eligibility is mentioned: \"only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since he didn't, he qualifies.\n\nSo the proof is the quote about the board favoring option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibitor and the 38% disease-control rate. The answer should be enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) with LDN-193189.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nEnrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) using LDN-193189\n</answer>",

A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization.

The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",

So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG after his tumor progressed on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context provided is pretty detailed, so I need to go through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the patient has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial, which combined panobinostat, ONC201, and low-dose temozolomide. After 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nLooking at the context, the interim data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. That's really short, which explains why he progressed quickly. The trial protocol mentions that upon progression, crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) is allowed only if the patient hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. Since he was on panobinostat and ONC201, which aren't ACVR1 inhibitors, he hasn't received any ACVR1-targeted therapy yet. \n\nThe tumor board favored option (1), the Phase I trial with LDN-193189, because he hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. The context states that the trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects. Momelotinib is an option but it's off-label, and the board preferred the clinical trial. Also, best supportive care is less aggressive, but given the disease-control rate, the trial seems more beneficial.\n\nI need to check if there's a direct quote supporting this. The context says: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\" That's a clear statement. Also, the crossover eligibility is mentioned: \"only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since he didn't, he qualifies.\n\nSo the proof is the quote about the board favoring option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibitor and the 38% disease-control rate. The answer should be enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) with LDN-193189.",

So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG after his tumor progressed on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context provided is pretty detailed, so I need to go through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the patient has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial, which combined panobinostat, ONC201, and low-dose temozolomide. After 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nLooking at the context, the interim data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. That's really short, which explains why he progressed quickly. The trial protocol mentions that upon progression, crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) is allowed only if the patient hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. Since he was on panobinostat and ONC201, which aren't ACVR1 inhibitors, he hasn't received any ACVR1-targeted therapy yet. \n\nThe tumor board favored option (1), the Phase I trial with LDN-193189, because he hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. The context states that the trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects. Momelotinib is an option but it's off-label, and the board preferred the clinical trial. Also, best supportive care is less aggressive, but given the disease-control rate, the trial seems more beneficial.\n\nI need to check if there's a direct quote supporting this. The context says: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\" That's a clear statement. Also, the crossover eligibility is mentioned: \"only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since he didn't, he qualifies.\n\nSo the proof is the quote about the board favoring option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibitor and the 38% disease-control rate. The answer should be enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) with LDN-193189.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nEnrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) using LDN-193189\n</answer>",

A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle.

Since the patient meets eligibility criteria for the ACVR1\u2011specific trial and this option offers the highest evidence\u2011based chance of disease control, it is the most appropriate next\u2011line therapy.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation\u2026 and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation\" \n- \"Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations\" \n- \"At the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement\u2026 consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen\" \n- \"The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition\" \n- \"Given the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG\u2026 the board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort\" \n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nEnrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial using LDN\u2011193189 (10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily) is the most appropriate next\u2011line therapy.\n</answer>",

                "analysis": "Okay, let me tackle this question. So, the user is asking which next-line therapeutic option is most appropriate for a 7-year-old boy with DIPG after his tumor progressed on the panobinostat + ONC201 regimen. The context provided is pretty detailed, so I need to go through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the patient has a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with H3K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations. He was on the PANO-ONC201-DIPG-A trial, which combined panobinostat, ONC201, and low-dose temozolomide. After 3 months, his tumor progressed. Now, the tumor board is considering three options: enrolling in an ACVR1-specific Phase I trial with LDN-193189, off-label momelotinib, or best supportive care.\n\nLooking at the context, the interim data shows that for dual-mutant tumors (H3K27M and ACVR1), the median PFS was only 2.1 months on the panobinostat+ONC201 regimen. That's really short, which explains why he progressed quickly. The trial protocol mentions that upon progression, crossover to an ACVR1-targeted agent (LDN-193189) is allowed only if the patient hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. Since he was on panobinostat and ONC201, which aren't ACVR1 inhibitors, he hasn't received any ACVR1-targeted therapy yet. \n\nThe tumor board favored option (1), the Phase I trial with LDN-193189, because he hasn't had prior ACVR1 inhibition. The context states that the trial reported a 38% disease-control rate in ACVR1-mutant cases with manageable side effects. Momelotinib is an option but it's off-label, and the board preferred the clinical trial. Also, best supportive care is less aggressive, but given the disease-control rate, the trial seems more beneficial.\n\nI need to check if there's a direct quote supporting this. The context says: \"The board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease-control rate of 38% in the ACVR1-mutant cohort, with manageable grade 2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).\" That's a clear statement. Also, the crossover eligibility is mentioned: \"only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\" Since he didn't, he qualifies.\n\nSo the proof is the quote about the board favoring option (1) due to no prior ACVR1 inhibitor and the 38% disease-control rate. The answer should be enrollment in the ACVR1-specific Phase I trial (NCT04556789) with LDN-193189.",
