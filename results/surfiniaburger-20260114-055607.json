MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm in longest diameter with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and no contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with high\u2011grade features. Molecular analysis demonstrated an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, and wild\u2011type TP53.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fI/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of ONC201 and panobinostat.
